7293,"If I would have written a review in the initial days of usage of these earphones; it would have been an amazing review of the product. But after 6 months of usage; I observed a volume difference between the two ear buds. This is something that is damaging for the ear. No one would recommend using such a product. Sennheiser should really look into the product's performance in longer term(more than 6 months). If the product is not able to deliver as promised after 6 months; then it should be mentioned in the product's description.

7278,"These are pathetic earphones for such a high price. I bought them after seeing good reviews but ended up feeling bad for taking a bad decision of buying them. They advertised as noise cancelling which is not. There is not any quantable noise cancelling or noise reduction. They feel loose in the ear and won't be comfortably inside the ear. After not more than a month of use; microphone is not working. Dealing with Senheiser Customer care now. Don't go for these ear phones. There is a reason why they are selling for 2.5k while the MRP of product is 4.5K. Because they are bad performing. Don't buy them.

Sennheiser CX 2.00G do not worth a 500 rs cost.I am writing names of earphones again N again because I found that Review Content for both the earphones 1-  Sennheiser CX 275 S; 2-  Sennheiser CX 2.00G is same.

Apart from the quality; I had hard time authenticating the earphones from sennheiser; as the QR code on the box doesn't work anymore and the customer care services over the call & mail are Horrible. After wasting cumulatively 3 hours over the phone listening to YOUR CALL IS IMPORTANT TO US; PLEASE HOLD THE LINE  and WASTING 4 days; (including sat and sun)  I had given up all the hopes and decided to send the product back to Amazon. But still somehow I convinced myself to keep the earphones ( may be due to the Positive Amazon reviews and my experience with Cx180.I Just hope that I never get a chance to use their warranty services.

5775,"First of all let me tell you the cons of this productCONS:--> Ergonomically poor design; the buds do not fit in ear they tend to slip off since it's metallic.--> Since it's not a in ear type and metallic; you can't keep the buds more than 30min; you start getting pain.--> Length of the cable is not as shown in the display images; it's lengthy and gets tangled.--> Button quality is not up to the mark. Ok ok--> Battery life is poor. It does not even last for 4 hours.--> Never expected JBL would do such poor engineering and did very bad ergonomic design for this product.--> Since the bud size is small I thought I could use it while riding bike with my helmet on. But as I told it's so slippery; there is no way you can use it with your helmet on. I was very disappointed with all these points.PROS:--> Sound quality is good. No complaints on that.I would definitely not suggest this product to anyone. It's up to you all.

Within 5 months rubber covering of right earbud removed autimatically ( glue issue ) when I check the same for left; its also having adhesion issue. I contacted JBL and they closed this issue as its physical damage. This damage is due to the non - durability of 2500/- product only.

5822,"First of all i want to convey  JBL to add to some quality in their products if they are charging such a high price for them. I want to share my honest observation and experience about my JBL BT.1. I bought this for the price of Rs. 2199/- which is quite high in comparison to other BT devices containg same features2. Noise cancellation is really poor that if i am outside somewhere the another caller is hardly able to understand the voice properly.3. I bought this device two months back from the very first day it gets disconnected from my mobile whenever any call come then i have to mannually connect it.4. Now its microphone stopped working and the worst part is  i deposited it to the JBL service center on 9th may 2019; they told me that they will take the time of 15days to replace the product even after waiting for more than 20 days i have not recieved any satisfactory answer from JBL customer support then what the hell the term warranty makes any sense.Now they told me that they don't have the same product in the stock and they also don't know when it will be in stock.I am highly disappointed from the customer service from such a highly reputed brand JBL; in my opinion this is just a ordinary BT earphones with a tag of JBL and no quality features.I request  JBL to look into the matter as soon as possible and arrange to replace my product.My service request no. is DL-E250519-25010

5264,"This is a typical ""let's make a fool out of Indians"" product ... and I am a ""foolish Indian.""Here are a few facts about this product: It is made in China; like every other Indian product is. And on the streets of Shenzhen; you will find this product for less than INR 100. 150 tops. At that price; this would have been a 5 star product. But; at about INR 700 ... this is a pathetically low quality product that has NOT gone through quality control.Let's see what all is wrong with the product: The biggest flaw is that these jokers have packaged two ear-plugs (or whatever they are called) for only one side of the headset. What do I mean? See the attached photo. Those are two ear plugs that go over the RIGHT side of the headset! Two!! Putting it more clearly; there's no ear-plug for the left speaker on the headset!! Why is that a problem? Because the plastic material on the headset is so slippery that it is impossible for the headset to stay in your ears. Putting it more clearly; without those rubber ear-plugs; the headset keeps slipping off my ear; and will possibly slip out of every other ordinary human being's ears!Issue #2: the controller; where you have the on/off and volume control buttons is so heavy that; without the rubber paddings (ear plugs mentioned earlier) the headset keeps slipping off.Issue #3: Are you driving? Are you jogging? Are you in a typical Indian public transport that rattles you to the last bone? Nope! You can't use this headset; because it will keep slipping out of your ears.So; why didn't I return it? Because:1. I am a typical Indian who likes to be made a fool of by Indian companies;2. I am lazy;3. I just didn't want to wait for Amazon's pick up person to come ""anytime it suits him"" or call me and say that he will pick it up some other day at his convenience.Overall; I lost INR 700 by being a typical Indian fool who wants to use modern products and hopes; wishes and prays that some Indian company will make them available to him ... and then spend his hard earned money to get such a product - but in stead gets just a plastic casing for that high price.Bottom line: don't buy this piece of junk. I wasted my money; but you shouldn't!

207,"After 15 days of research I ordered this product. I got the neon one. The band is flexible and lightweight. I mostly use this while I go for cycling; on the first day; I just kept my mobile in the front basket of the cycle I was not able to hear any sound from the earphone. Later I moved my phone somewhat near to me then I'm able to hear songs. This is the first thing which I didn't like. Second thing was there is no noise cancellation; very poor noise cancellation. People on the other end of the call are able to hear everything from the background. They are not able to hear my voice properly; background noise was so clear that they disconnected my call telling that they're getting headache. After this incident I immediately returned the product. Usually I don't write reviews for anything; whether it's good or bad. But if I don't write many users will buy the product unknowingly. So do not go for this product. It is not good in any way. Leave about bass and all. There's is no noise cancellation and poor connectivity issues.

Better go for Mi sports basic headsets that 's much better and has a balanced sound. Or if you have a good budget; go with the Jays t-Four or RHA; they are just WOW!!

32,"Update: Sadly this is the second Boat product to conk off after few months of use. I guess this is the end of the journey for you and I Boat Audio; not buying any more products from your brand. Changed the rating to reflect the same.I was in the market for a cheap pair of Bluetooth earphones and I chanced upon this on a lightning deal and bought it. I have used Boat products before; they have good build quality and their sound is alright. I‚Äôm writing this after a month or so; enough time to have lived with it and get to know quirks and other problems.‚Ä¢ The sound is nothing great; it‚Äôs a bit on the bassy side. If you‚Äôre a bass lover; this is definitely a good buy.‚Ä¢ Connectivity is quick and painless ‚Äì and it works without hassle every time. The quality of the connectivity depends and is sometimes weird. I can put the phone on charge and use it for a distance of about 3 meters; no worries. But sometimes when I‚Äôm walking really fast or jogging there are breaks and crackles in audio. Not sure if it‚Äôs the material of my gym wear; but it works well when the phone‚Äôs in my jeans.‚Ä¢ Battery life is nothing to write home about ‚Äì I listen to music constantly even when I‚Äôm at work. My demands are probably too high for this price range.‚Ä¢ It is sweat-proof as advertised. No interruptions under a light drizzle.‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs got great build quality for the price ‚Äì looks and feels premium. Doesn‚Äôt tangle at all.‚Ä¢ It stays in your ear regardless of the intensity of the exercise which is great.On the whole a great buy if you are looking for a cheaper alternative. Wait for a sale before you get it though.Like my reviews? Please do click the helpful button. It encourages me to share more about the products I use. Thanks!

During charging there‚Äôs no LED indicator. So sometimes if cable is loose or something you won‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs not charging.2. The on/off switch is not UX friendly. you can‚Äôt tell by touch if you‚Äôre pressing  volume buttons or power button. All Buttons are diamond shaped. Extremely annoying when you‚Äôre in a hurry.3. The Bluetooth pairing is not intuitive. You have to switch on phone Bluetooth and then the earphone. If you switch on the earphone and then the phone Bluetooth; the earphone won‚Äôt initiate pairing(I know it‚Äôs not the problem with iPhone; because my previous Bluetooth used to work this way) . This is very stupid. So you have to re-start the earphone.4. Double press on volume buttons doesn‚Äôt perform next/previous function. Other earphones are capable of this very basic function.5. Occasional buzz or distortion. Sometimes there is a buzzing distortion. On restart of the earphone it goes away.

The audio quality doesn't sound like a genuine JBL make.. with very cheap BASE and slightly HIGH TREBLE.. it's not a pleasant product to enjoy music with.. sounds like the Chinese made ‚Çπ150 earphones.. i bought this product once and had it returned.. but then there was no available option for a refund. The Customer service executive asked me to have the product replaced and check the product quality as the one i recieved might have been damaged for some reason. I agreed and after 3 days i received my product today and it's a NEW one but now i realise the product quality.. the problems i mentioned earlier still persist. There was no defects in the earlier one either.. And now i return it again and i see a refund option.. but then initially i used my VISA card to pay.. and now the refund would only credit into my Amazon Pay Balance and not my bank account. Amazon wants me to spend that money on buying products from Amazon itself n wouldn't refund it to me. Anyways that shouldn't matter me as im a frequent user of the Amazon Pay Balance. But who knows it might be a matter of fact to other people using Amazon out there. That's again pretty disappointing.

Generally ; I don't have the habit of writing product reviews but this s*** earphones made me review this in order to save the other consumers who are planning to buy this CRAP. In my opinion ;;Firstly ; An earphone should be comfortable to wear. In this regard;; it makes you to cry in pain even after 5 minutes of usage !! Secondly ; it should have a good audio Quality !! It's just okayish when it comes to sound quality; Nothing great to talk about it. Overall; Never buy this earphone even if they give it for free unless if you wanna hurt your ears with this abysmal earphones.

I saw that these didn't have a good rating on amazon; but still bought them because I trusted jbl. But as it turns out these are equivalent to cattle - excrement. I've never been so disappointed in something before. I absolutely hated the sound. I thought I'll give it another day and voila; the earphones have the craftsmenship of a toddler's craft from pottery class.

I thought it was a virus at first but after thorough scanning with different anti- viruses with no signs; I realized that it was indeed my earphone that was actually messing around with my smartphone. Also the sound quality was not worth right from the start (maybe I received a defective piece). It had more trebel and hardly any  bass.

And the ear pains a lot after half an hour of usage due to the ear-holder kind of thing provided on the buds. I won't recommend this to anyone. I read and watched a lot of reviews before buying this. Most reviews were rating it pretty high. So I have learned one thing; do not go solely on these reviews when buying things from these kinds of manufacturers; those might be paid ones..!Happy Shopping!!

85,"I don't usually write reviews for products but I must do for this one to let people know about the issues I am facing. I will try to cover all aspects of these earphones in this review.*Reliability:*The earphones get disconnected after some time if you don't use it for like 3-4 hours. It's very frustrating since you have to start the earphones first before picking up the call. Also; when you pick up the call you don't know whether to use phone or earphones to speak since you don't know whether they are connected. Though a small issue; it's really frustrating; trust me.*Experience:*The earphones are pretty useful and give all kinds of signals (if you have plugged it in your ear) like connected; disconnected; battery low. But what is most frustrating is the battery low signal which is not just a beep; but a long sentence it says ""Oops; battery low"". This keeps on repeating every 30 seconds which really annoys me. If the battery is low; it should just beep if they have to. But every time bugging is not a good experience.Also; it takes a bit too long to power on and power off. You have to press the button for like 5-7 seconds.*Sound Quality:*The first song I listened to these earphones sounded really terrible with high bass. But it's not really bad if you are not into too much sound details.*Build Quality:*Build quality is really good. No issues with that.*Battery life*Satisfied with battery life. But it doesn't last that long as promised. But I am okay with that.

70,"The wire from the band to the ears is too long. Previously; I was using Skull Candy (which i lost so went in for a cheaper option). Skull Candy wire length was perfect. In Boats Rockerz; because the wire is too long; it keeps bumping against my neck when i run. The sound of the wire hitting the neck echoes in the ear pieces. Also; when i do floor exercises; the longish wire hangs uncomfortably around the neck. Sound quality and battery life is decent for the price; though. So if you plan to buy it for casual listening; go ahead. Wouldn't recommend for serious workouts.

In terms of comfort; never really had any issues despite running it for a continuous 2-3 hours once. Buds are soft and fit in snugly.

The battery life on this thing is highly inconsistent even when I'm listening to music at same volume( It has happened quite a few times that I charge it to a 100 at night but it doesn't last more than an hour ). The second issue I want to point out is the Bluetooth connectivity. This device connected in a blink for a month or so; but then it used to suddenly disconnect from my device. After a month I started facing issues connecting to the device; sometimes ( even with full battery ) the device was not discoverable. As a whole I would not recommend this pair of wireless earphones.

After this just gives 3-4 warning within 5minutes of play and it'll go off. 60% battery means; it should hold at least for 30-40 mins but it doesn't. Good in terms of bass and sound quality.

8129,"It was awesome the music and no complaints regarding quality. But I found one thing very disturbing was when I connect it with my mobile or laptop there seems to be motor or some sound that runs in both earphones; when music is being played it couldn't be heard but when it is quiet and when it is connected to any device that motor sound comes. Its very disturbing. Not sure it's a thing in every earphone.
",3,1
503,"Overall its a good deal in the price given. I think the noise cancellation could have been better.Also if you use continuously battery doesn't last more than 4 hours. At times it becomes irritating as despite having headphones you wait until you go back and charge it. Did not help in long travelling hours. Keep a wired headphones with you if don't want to be bored when the battery goes off.

The sound quality is good enough with proper noise cancellation but my product's sound quality detoriated along with its age and suddenly a day; the earphone was one live and one dead by the end of 6 months.

5766,"Even though; the Sound Quality and In Ear design is good; for couple of Ergonomic reasons; I am not satisfied with the following Features in the Ear Phones:1. Skipping/Changing songs- Very difficult. need to Hold for 2 Secs to change- Which is  very difficult while you are on a  jog/fast run. Need to completely slow down and Hold the Button.2. Volume Changing Button is inside and it takes couple of seconds to locate the VOlume Button and Press. Tedious and Very much iritating.3. The Driver Set and Mic Piece is very large and and heavy and which makes the ear piece to fall off while on a run/Jog.4. There is NO option for Clipping to our sports wear to avoid a Fall off.I had faced this Troubles More number of time in first 1 hour of the usage.  I feel my Present Iphone wired Earphones are the best.Please consider this feedback and have some deign Modification.I dont have Any Feedback on the Seller. Seller Communication  and Delivery was Perfect and very much Satisfied.I have requested for the Refund for Earphone.

7188,"Pros:Really good quality sound.Perfect balance of treble and bass.Value for money.Lightweight.Good for every genre of music.Cons:Really thin wire seems fragile I fear I might accidentally rip them with simple pull.Three button pad is big compared to the thin wire; it just looks ugly in my opinion.sometimes i hear distortion when i listen to hip hop.I mostly listen to all genres.These give better kicks when listened to rock.More dept when listened to edm.These are definitely better than the previous pair (RHA M390U) which I've owned. Enhances the sound quality. You need to have good quality mp3 files to get most out of this earphone. Gives me studio feel even when I'm in public. Earbuds are very comfortable in my ears. I could hear instruments which I've never heard before in  songs. Definitely best earphones I've owned. Feels like there's orgy in my ears when I listen to songs with these. It's like someone's pouring sweet syrup in my ears.

7205,"I would have given 2 stars to the product has it not been for Sennheiser's after sales support.The product build quality is not great and it developed wrinkles at multiple place with normal usage. The wire length got reduced drastically after the wire twisted from several places. Even the music was not extraordinary but it was definitely decent.However; the mic and earphones were good if you compare it to other brands; just that it did not meet the high expectations one normally associates with Sennheiser. One of the earpieces stopped working 5 months after purchase. But a big THANKS to the best after sales support of Sennheiser; the product was replaced in 5 minutes with no questions asked!Kudos to Sennheiser to have such a customer friendly attitude and have such warranty policies which are actually there to help customers and not bog them down with questions and procedures.I will buy Sennheiser again despite this product being average given its cost because I am not afraid that my product might be faulty or develop a fault.Verdict - Buy this product for the decent sound with a great mic and the promise of Sennheiser. Audiophiles can look for other options!

7206,"I recently bought a Sennheiser CX213 earphone for just Rs.699/- from flipkart ;over the years I have been buying headphones of different makes including Bose & to my pleasant surprise the no frills 213 exceeded all my expectations.The Sennheiser CX 275 S has a mic & comes with add-ons such as a nice leatherette pouch; two pairs of extra earbuds of diff sizes for better ear canal fit and a L cable adapter for Rs.1648 on Amazon but quality and performance wise CX213 is a much better product at less than half the price of  CX 275 S.So if you don't mind the absence of a mic and want to just listen to music or watch videos go for CX213 hands down. Quality of the wire in CX 213 is much better than that of the CX 275 S & longer too.

7210,"Pros:1) probably the best nice cancellation earphones at this price.2) you'll feel each and every nood seperately.3) great for those who don't like bass hevey garbages.4) Carrying punch is of good quality.5) The music will not be distributed when your earphones cable collide with your clothes or hands ( hope you're getting what I'm trying to say)Cons:1) Low bass ( bid still that's more than enough for me)2) Earphones are not tangle free.3) Thin cable; so requires extra care(so it's not for kids and idiots)

7213,"I think sennheiser has degraded the built quality of these pair of earphones I'm saying this on behalf of my personal experience because I have been using this earphones from 2015(from croma at rs 1600) and again I bought it in dec 2018 but from Amazon at rs1585 (price in croma rs 1699 on dec.25.2018).

I think I have used XB350 earphones of Sony earlier for 2 years that is why I was not satisfied but the thing is that the build quality of these Sennheiser earphones is not good and also have distortion.

Even if the battery is 30 to 40 % it keeps yelling ; battery is low charging is required which is little bit annoying.Sound quality is good and even when traveling in trains it did not get much distracted / disconnected .Good piece for this pricing.But as the brand;  it little bit discourages regarding the sound quality while playing songs mainly the bass.

The first was 1.5 years ago and it lasted me a whole 1.5 years before dying on me.This model from Appario Retail has barely lasted me 2 months before sound is fading off and on in my right earbud. Wondering if it's an original/refurbished model. Plan to check with the Sennheiser store.

7208,"A decent pair of earphones; and pretty damn solid for the untrained ear. It's fairly loud; and a little heavier on the bass side which at times makes the audio a little murky; but for the most part; above average at this price range. The most disappointing feature about these earphones is the quality of the materials used to make it. Nothing short of awful; it's very fragile and if not given extreme care will break. Heck even the cheap ‚Çπ300 MI earphones have better build quality than this. So; an absolute no go for rough users.I would recommend this to casual home listener's who can take care of their gear.

Bass quality - 2 on 5.Overall you could but them for ‚Çπ1000 bucks may be. It's not worth ‚Çπ2000.It's disheartening even writing this as I'm a big fan of Sennheiser.I've used the CX180; CX275s and both were worth the buy. Amazing products by Sennheiser.

The reason for 3 stars is because it doesn't work with imo/viber/messenger voice calls. During the voice calls on these apps the sound comes through mobile speaker not the Bluetooth earphones; but on regular mobile calls it works perfectly fine.

7316,"The major issue with this IEM is the build quality. The wire is so thin; it's almost on the verge of being invisible. The plastic used for mid and earset doesn't give any assurance either. The sound compared to other recent earphones in the same price segment is at best passable. The bass isn't rich; the music doesn't feel lively; although vocals seems fine.The right-side earphone stopped working after a year and a half; no  doubt due the higher probability of wear and tear with this set.Skip this; and go for Byron's or SOUND magic E 11 C
",3,1
7320,"1. Build quality is not the finest. You cannot expect such a low build quality from a Rs1400 earphones(price at the time when I bought it) from a brand like sennheiser. Specially the wire is  too thin.2. Sound quality is great ; just what you expect from sennheiser. Bass is punchier. You can get a little bit of cracking in sound above 85%3. Definitely not a value for money product if you are seeking for good durable earphones
",3,1
7322,"It's light weight; and sound quality is descent. Only thing what I don't like is it's not durable. The wire with connector jack is fragile. You need to always take extra care. Personally I always like the ones which has right angle with connector jack which protects most of the time.

7326,"It has great sound quality. No doubt in that. But the hardware part especially cables are so thin that a normal usage would tear them at the joints.I used it while running and in gym. the cable are almost torn.It is a great headphone to be used at one place such as office desk.Overall; go for it; if you want to have a static use of it.##Update: It has been a year now. One ear bud isnt working.I am probably gonna buy it again. :(

We can increase the bass by using equilizer but even though with equilizer the experience improved very slightly and also after using Equalizer the voice losses it's originality. Will not recommend it if one is hoping for rich bass with quality earphone. Used JBL C100si (wired) and boat - Rs. 1500 (Bluetooth) both were way better then this.

",3,1
5794,"Now that I've been using the product for about a month I'll discuss the pros and cons of the earphones in a detailed way.Pros- sound quality is good. You can feel the kicks when it comes to hard hitting songs. Sound has clarity and bass and treble is well balanced.Cons- the earphones are not at all comfortable; they keep falling often and it really pains the ear for long working sessions. You cannot keep it in your ear for more than an hour or two. And regarding the sound; it gets distorted at high volume and also the bass gets lost. At mid-volume it's okay.And regarding the battery; it's really terrible. It's written that you can use it for six hours but I can hardly use it for four hours. The battery is really disturbing.The Bluetooth connectivity isn't bad but it gets distorted over a small range. Like if my phone is in the next room I can play the dock in the current room. But if your phone is in the next room you'll not be able to connect to these earphones from the current room.Overall I would say it's okay if you are just buying it for leisure but if you're buying it for jogging or other workout sessions then go for other earphones. These one's are not usable for working out. The buds will keep falling. Considering other reputed brands I'd say that these earphones are okay and not bad at this price range.
",3,1
7344,"The Quality of Sound is Great; The Design is also Good; Light Weight but the Wires are very Thin and gets Entangled and not recommended for Rough Use. One of the Ear phone got damaged (Suddenly No Sound) even when from Outside everything looked Ok.Price is also too high. Sennheiser being such a Reputed brand MUST Look into its Durability aspects; as its not a Fair Purchase spending Rs. 1900 for the use of just 8 Months. Next Time I would not Purchase it as Market offers Branded Products at 1/4th; 1/5th the Price

5779,"Product got delivered on 03-Feb-2019. Microphone stopped working after one month in first week of Mar-2019. Today is 3th April; exactly from last 1 month i am searching for service center which accept headphones repairs and trying to get in touch in with JBL officials; however i am not able to due pathetic JBL after sales service. They claim they do not handle headphones nor do they revert to mails (send to customer care and service center guys).Update: After almost one month of following up with Jbl; I received brand new headphones.Happy with it. But customer service is slow to respond.

7363,"Is this sennheiser earphone original and genuine product? I got this product yesterday and im trying to check authenticity on sennheiser website. But its failing to confirm the authentication!

",3,1
5774,"Bought this 1 month back. Very impressive sound quality and reasonable bass and noise cancellation as well. But lacking few important features. 1) No multipoint connection. You can pair to only one device at a time 2) No auto off (battery saving feature) when not in connection with any of your devices. It drains battery at the end of the day even if not connected! and not available to use (due to batter drain throughout the day) when you really want to use it. 3) No magnet in the backside of the earbuds. So; you need to take extra care when you hang them around your neck.I am unhappy with these drawbacks at this price because; my 1200Rs BT earbuds is having these features built in. Hence giving 3* even though I like the sound quality.
",3,1
5773,"I bought these a few days back and after a lot of thought. Here's my impression:PROS:1. Sound quality - these Bluetooth earphones are quite clear and crisp which I loved; however I find that on call and even in general the volume output is low so often you have to keep it on maximum which I don't think it's heathy at all.2. Noise cancellation - these earphones have zero noise cancellation since they are not earbud style; so if you are in noisy traffic chances are you will struggle to hear music and the caller on the line3. Bluetooth range - the range is good; you can get as far as one room away with no distortion nor disturbance which is very pleasant; I really liked that. However it struggles to stay connected should you travel any further than that. Decent range; works for me4. Built quality - the build quality is as can be expected for an earphone in the range but even then it's good; well finished and the flat cable really does help quite a bit to keep from a tangled mess!5. Battery life - with medium usage it lasted me close to 1¬Ω days on a single charge which is not shabby.CONS:1. The design of the headset with the battery on the one side and the microphone unit on the other is very flawed because inadvertently if you are using only one earphone the battery unit pulls the microphone to the back of your head and you have to constantly adjust. It happens even when you wear both; either a neckband on the section that goes around or even a clip to tighten the wire on the back of the head would have been a good addition2. The earphones - I found that since these rest just inside the ear opening they need constant adjusting as they tend to shift as you are working or moving; plus my ears started hurting a little as some point; not to the extent of returning these or not keeping them in but I believe providing mini ear hooks would have been a good idea so that they keep the earphones snug and immobile
",3,1
7364,"This earphone is good when it comes to sound quality although bass is little low. But in my situation it‚Äôs 3.5mm jack is not so good after 4;5 months of usage i was sometimes not able to listen from my left earpiece but after rotating headphone jack a little bit it was okay and then the mic problem also. I don‚Äôt know why but durability of this product is not so good

7367,"Product cost is more.  This product is not value for money for the price which we pay. The quality of the wire also looks substandard.  Once if the wire gets damaged we have to keep running for warranty to hear unnecessary comments.  Instead its better to go to boat 225 hands free and its half the price of the Senehiser CS-275 S.

7245,"My Mother is pleased with these earphones. The Sennheiser bag is very sleek and presentable.Personally I found the audio to be okay-ish. The loudness is on the higher side and the bass seems to be excessive; overwhelming other sounds. It is not bad but it is lacking the signature Sennheiser balance and quality.This may be a good fit for phones that come sans a 3.5 mm jack. Audio over USB is low energy; and these loud earphones should even it out. My Mother is using this with a Le 2.
",3,1
7247,"Its best headphone with clear sound and amazing bass; although the effect of base is best while listening it in less noise. As it doesn‚Äôt have any noise isolation but still if it perfectly fit in ears the sound is least effect with considerable noise. That is; it‚Äôs great for general commute. Its mike is also great with it position and recording quality makes it best for calling.Although it‚Äôs not a deal breaker but like me do not expect much with l shaped extension adapter it only works with Samsung or some selected device. And it is also mention on its cover.Comparing it with Sony MDR series (extra bass series) Schneider headphone is way ahead in sound quality; although it depends on your taste but it like Sony MDR series have special punch to bass slightly cutting other aspects like tone quality and treble. Schneider (This model) have almost the same (or better bass) with even better quality of other sound; other than sound it‚Äôs also have superior in comfort and ergonomics.The only thing it lag is the build quality; in almost same price tag Sony MDR series are IP68 and build to last till you are bored with it. While this headphone needs to be treated like a baby and the other trade off with Schneider is lesser service centre in India.So; if you are planning for workout or training music then forget this try Schneider‚Äôs higher sports model or try Sony; Skullcandy etc. but if you are music lover looking only for premium sound quality then it‚Äôs the best in this price range.

There is a U shaped clip at the end of which two wires are attached which connects to earphones. The sturdy clip has to hang round your neck all the time. If you are running; the clip might start rotating and that would slowly force one of the earbud come of your ear. Pretty annoying...believe me; you have to turn the clip time and again to hang it around your neck in correct position. Also; while doing ab crunches it will keep on falling back and take both the earbuds along with it.I was mislead with the pictures; I thought it is all wire and no clip but its not. Just wanted to point this out so you dont make the same mistake ;)But if you are not into too much workout and want it for travel; then connection range and awesome beats is great deal.Cheers.

The battery doesn't support more than 3-4 hours of playtime; even at 70% volume.2. Great bass which might sometimes overshadow the mid and high tones.3.

I am using these since 15 days now and haven't noticed any major drawback; except that the Bluetooth keeps disconnecting if you are using it while on bike. Some modulations are noticed then.

",3,1
13939,"Pros: Crisp sound. Good bass. Good volume range.Cons: Works smoothly for the first month or two. Post that you realise that there are connection issues due to minor obstructions like fabric or even if device is obstructed by a body part (neck or hand); so the sound falters. Initially I could keep my mobile in my trouser pocket and listen to the music; but later on there was so much of connection stability issues; I had to hold it in my hand or keep it in direct; unobstructed range from the device. You can also see a drastic dip in the range between device and the headset over a period of time.Eventually; it pretty much becomes as good as a regular earphone; because of the way and distance you have to place your device from you phone or laptop.I had to replace it after 4 months (it was in it warranty period). The condition of the replaced product is the same now. Might get it changed again; I think; because its still in the warranty period. The good part about their service centre is that they replace it without asking questions; as long as you have the valid invoice with you.

170,"Overall:  Decent product; not worth the cost.Issues below are experience over 1 week of using the product on iPhone 6.Pros: Sturdy material; flexible behind the neck strap and wire quality durable and tangle free. Good battery life.Cons: The device does not have good Bluetooth connectivity. If your phone is more that one foot away from you; the sound gets cut off very often. For example; if you have your phone in your handbag/backpack/pocket; you can expect multiple cut offs; especially while moving (walking; using a scooter/motorcycle). If you move further away you need to be in direct sight of the phone for continuous music (if you turn your back to the phone or if there is any obstruction (not even a wall; a bathroom stall door is all it takes) the music gets cut off. Not sure if it is just my piece but this is very frustrating.The ear pieces have magnets so that it connects around your neck when not in use; however this makes each ear piece heavier; as a result if you are using smaller in-ear buds; they tend to fall out due to the weight of the ear piece. This becomes a hassle while working out; particularly jogging/running.

Panasonic; boat; etc.. all in same range approx. But i still prefer senihizer cx 180 over boat 225.  Boat just has too much of base the voice mainly feels submerged. I had to turn off all the equalizers ( music app and mobile ) so that I could get a better voice..however it feels too bass.

Bass may be there but the sound is not powerfull and sharp. I tried to switch between plug in ear phone and boat wireless and found that the sound is not great although bass may be there.2. As some user has mentioned the mic is not good which i also feel3. If you arr looking for style then it doesn't look stylish. The earphone wires should come from behind not front as it looks odd.4. Noise cancellation is good.5. Ear comfort is ok.If i have to buy again i would rather by wireless earphone at 600 bucks from metro station amd may feel disappointed rather than spending 1500 buck and feeling disappointed.This product should be in the range of 600  to 800 maxStill if you need something desperately wireless and at some affordable cost then its ok.Have heard from some colleagues that you may find some good wireless earphone from Ali express

Definitely not suitable for laptops - it keeps disconnecting frequently for no reason. Recently it starts doing the same with my mobiles as well. Battery is not great with daily 1 hours of hearing battery lasts max 3 days. The string is annoyingly long; it dangles upto your stomach. I have seen earphones with reasonable length; this one is awkwardly designed. You cannot wear them without getting attention from onlookers.If you are ready to spend another 1000 bucks go for good brands like JBL; Senheiser etc. If you want to cut cost; well this is the Best among the other worsts in the market

Detects and connects easily.Battery life is good. Stayed around 10-11 hrs.As i received this yesterday evening. Have been playing since then. So its just the first day review. But performance is good.Earphones looks solid. Build quality is good. The magnates are really helpful to hold the earphones. Earphones looks great.Earphone wire could be bit long. But that's fine for me. Not sure about others.Didn't get chance to charge so not sure about the time to full charge.One thing i observed during my 10 hours play time that the music stopped playing itself in middle. Not sure it it gets disconnected or there is some technical problem.But overall performance was nice. Good experience.

I bought these for 999/- but i don't think so they are worth that. My senhessier cx wired earphones are way too much better than these; way too much. So if u want to buy these then buy only for the sake of wireless feature and not for the sound and build quality.

Also; the left earpiece projects lower sound than the right one.>It does not inform when the Bluetooth gets disconnected after going out of range.>Becomes useless after the battery reaches 20%.

I am not a sound specialist but i am a good listener. My first lengthy review is below.Pros:1. BASS; really heavy bass.2. while listening to music; Double press invokes the last phone call . On the GO call. So when riding in bike it is useful to call my wife ;-)3. can use it when wearing a helmet.4. really good wires and sturdy. So life of the earphone is assured.5. Neck design if u like it.6. Easy to connect. Range/Connectivity is good even when there are many obstacles in between.Cons:1. Mic is at the end of the neck design i.e not closer to mouth. So the other person on the call can't hear properly. Mic picks up so many noise as no MEMS in this.2. Bass is not everything in music. Too much of bass. Even equalizer adjustments to reduce the bass does not help.3. Battery life is mediocre when compared to others.I have bought Mi basic bluetooth headset after returning this.Pros: Dynamic enjoyable bass even at higher volume; MIC noiseless;Cons: wire quality is poor. have to keep it carefully.CHEERS!!!

So to listen to music and watch movies without fatigue and noise of the train is very much important for me. To put in short; this ear phone is neutral. Sound quality of this ear phone is  very good. Those who love neutral sound (which is the best option to listen to all types of music); can very well opt for this. Sound equilibrium from high freequency to low without distortions is well maintained. (I can give u a tip to check your audio listening devices. Play ""Bohemian Rhapsody by queen. The song covers all most all freequency levels; with different vocals and instruments.)  No sickening high bass. Those who love thumping bass may opt for other ear phones.But....... This product is not worth what it costs. The same quality of Sound can be obtained from a JBL  C100SI earphone as well (Durabilty of the mentioned JBL product is below average.

Quality of the audio was good.. noise cancellation was decent; though I didn't test it much except for listening to music in front of the TV or somebody talking. You can take calls and end calls with the call button. It is the only single button present there. Voice quality is average and it was snubbing the voice a bit. On the main screen if you press the button; it would open the default music player and starts playing a song. If you press again; it will pause it. It is capable of capturing FM radio signals. This is tested on Samsung S3 as a headset. On apple ipad as a headphone. The volume up down buttons were not present.

The problem with sound it that Your ears will bleed; as it‚Äôs sound quality is not good at full but yes if you keep it with volume at 75% it will give you an Awsome sound experience which you‚Äôll love. At this price-range it‚Äôs a good deal. 4/5 rating for it‚Äôs sound quality at this price.

7235,"Well first things first .Awesome product jst buy it ..But here are some pros and cons .Pros:-1. good clear crips sounds.2. Bass is adequate enough but i think it is lacking bass .( but enjoyable )3. design is good .4. noise cancellation is good.5. 2 warranty is great .Cons:-1. The wire is so thin I'm having doubts about the durability of the product .. (since it's about 1700 the product should have be gud ( should have given a breaded cable))2.Bass is not enough i think (considering the price).Overall the best earphones u can but if u can look past the thin wire and not enough bass .

7331,"Product Related:Pros:1) High quality sound (Bass-Trebal-Mids are optimally set)2) intricate design with good packaging.3) Microphone is highly receptive and sound quality is good.4) Plays well with all types of music and adjusts to the variations very quickly.Cons:1) Very very delicate. Try to mess with it will get damaged.2) Extremely thin wires makes it tangle easily.3) cannot distinguish left and right (maybe anyone can be used I presume)4) Cannot be used in extremes (running; gym-ing etc) - I fear of damaging it as it's so delicate.Amazon Service: One word for it - Amazing!!!

7334,"When I first tried these ear buds; I did not have them far enough inside the ear and the sound was very tinty.This morning; I seemed to have placed the buds further into my ears and the quality of the sound improved 1;000 fold.The size of the rubber ear pieces is extremely important. The bass seems absent unless the buds are fully inside ear. The only downside I see is the lack of volume control and ability to switch tracks when listening to music. Hope to have provided a helpful review.

7233,"Sennheisers are meant for the production of perfect sound. These aren't for bass listeners. These are only for high fidelity sound listeners. I am using Sennheiser since 5 years firstly CX 180; then CX 3.00; and now CX 2.00G. These have a perfect flat sound response. Has High Treble; Balanced Bass.The only issue is that they are very sensitive to humidity; sweat; and water. I had kept them in my front pocket in the humid climate in Mumbai. The one side that encountered sweat; or humidity and sounded a little low. But got replaced in the Service Center. Just be cautious while using it and prevent it from any type of water or sweat. Their service centers are only big cities in India; and getting them replaced is a tedious task. Sennheiser please note this issue that these earphones are very prone to water. I had used CX 3.00 and they did not have this problem (by the way I had put them in Washing Machine thrice) but the sound was not affected a bit and lasted more than 3 years (after which its wire got torn). So for the sound; these are perfect; but only if you prevent it from water.

7259,"It's been just over 2 months since I purchased these headphones.. good balanced sounds; with good clarity.. even while on call. The overall pitch is higher than Bose; but the sound quality is almost the same.. Bass is not punchy; likeable. Highs; mids and lows are very well balanced; you can hear every note and instrument in the background. Can be a suitable alternative to Bose in ear wired headphones. The only place where Bose notches up is in the reproduction of overall sound; which gives a surround sound like feel.. and no doubt more clearer sounds. But this still is a good and cheaper alternative

7261,"Review post using this earphones after a weekGo for it !!!!!My highlights with priorities for this earphones:1. Thump : more than enough thump for the beats which also produces a more than decent amount of bassA kick-ass hearing experience. For that if you could adjust little bit of your equalizer well from internal setting then it will be with you for sure2. Clearly awesome in highs n lows n mids as well .. again make proper equalizer even if you don't do it its there ..sound quality is just there3. Vocals - if there are more than a person singing a song at a time . Trust me you can hear both the voices clearly along considering above 2 points (bass; highs; lows and mids)4. Best fit in the ear - small and light weight so you don't have to adjust now n thenSome improvement areas -Need to give promising build qualityWires are very thin but decent to useEarbuds given are not that comfortable so I replaced them with my old ones

7286,"Good earphones but they don't have volume control. I had assumed (stupid me) that at this price point; they would just be created with them; like magic! But no. I usually get soundmagic e10c instead. They've less bass but better build quality and volume control.

7262,"Perfect mix of bass and treb.So soothing for ears;can listen to music for hours.Having headphones from various manufacturers; I can assure you this one is deffinitely a fantastic product given the price range of under 3k.If you want extreme bass plz opt for brand sony or JBL.Wire build quality is good;though not 100% tangle free somewhat good avoiding tangle;can see pics attached.Overally 4 star from me.

7265,"Ordered product on early september 2018; delivery was timely as usual. After approximately 6 months of use; here's what I observed.PROS1. Sound quality is really good. Covers frequency ranging from 10 hz. to 15;000 hz. Means; excellent bass; and remarkable treble sounds.2. The mouthpiece; or the mic; is also really good. I have found that the clarity at the other end is pretty good even when I am riding a bike @60kmph; which brings me to another point3. I occasionally listen to songs on this earphone while riding bike; and I have to tell you; noise cancelation is phenomenal.4. Another good thing I noted about this piece is that; while you are on a call and you speak on the mic; the earpiece gives you a feedback of your voice. In other words; you can hear yourself speak on the earpiece; which I found to be an interesting quirk. Reason being; in most of the noise cancelation earphones; you can't hear your voice; except for a deep rumbling on your chest (try speaking with your fingers plugging your ears)CONS1. Well; the wire noise is a bit turn off. Could have been better; but it is not too much to complain about anyway.2. Now this one really gets me. The left and right earpieces are reverse! From a brand like Sennheiser; this simply is negligence. Now; this doesn't make much of difference to someone who does not really care about where the sound is coming from; but for music lover like myself; this is a bummer. Your favorite song does not sound; well; like it should.But then; you can always switch your ears... Put left on right and right on left. That fixes everything; and there is no discomfort in your ears if you do so.But still...Anyway; a 4 star from my side. Fix the left right issue; and its a 5 star product.

Its audio quality was great in all freq ranges whether its low; high or mid it was engineered perfectly. biggest con of the earphone is its build quality the wires are too thin and could be damaged easily for a rough user it will brake easily(for such user i would suggest to go for something with kevlar;flat or braided wires ) i consider myself a rough user i would fell asleep with my earphones on plugging it on either phone or my laptop. it finally took a tall on it. it started tearing of on joints and and other parts were it usually bend or gets tangled today its left driver stopped working due to damage on the wire. it  worked perfectly fine for 2years which is great considering its thin wires.

Perfect for EDM lovers.The connection range does not extend to another room.Rarely; there are problems with connecting to the device; not a red flag.Hardware:The device does not sit perfectly on your shoulder; it slides about; may be a red flag for certain users.The magnets that are supposed to hold the earbuds together are very weak and keep disconnecting.Noise cancellation works very well.Battery life is somewhat poor. The output of a fully charged device is less than 6 hours.Can't say much about durability now as it hasn't been long since I bought it. All I can say is; JBL has much better durability than Skullcandy.Overall:For its price; it's a catch.

7485,"The Sennheiser CX275 S is an excellent earphone with very good sound quality. The brand is doing a justice for the sound clarity and the bass of any song provided. The only cons is that the wire quality is not so very strong and seems tangle very much which makes it quite delicate to handle when kept inside the pocket. Since it is priced higher; the quality of the wire can be changed.Otherwise; the earphones is a good buy.

",4,2
7345,"sound quality is good. bass and treble balance is adequate. its priced slightly on the higher side may be because of its looks and brand name. I would suggest to them to cut about 200-300 bugs on it if they want to steal the costumers away from other brands. As such one cannot see the design once they are in your ears. Built quality is good and they provide a small pouch with it to stow your earphones which is handy as it prevents it from tangling if kept just like that.

I was correct on that part; the wires are too thin making the device vulnerable to wear and tear (and we are considering to buy a wire protector).PROS:Apart from that we have been blown away with the comfort while listening to media; it does not stress out your ears. Noise cancellation features are true to what they have claimed and the music streaming is the best( true to their reputation)All in all; I am satisfied with the purchase just that need to be a but careful with the product ( cannot be handled as how we really do with our usual earphones)

",4,2
7219,"Sennheiser CX225S has been on my list of earphones to try because of its earpiece design. I love that it's in-ear model and comes with a total of 3 earpieces; small medium and large. I use the small ones. They're very extremely weight and don't seem to weigh the earphones down while they're in use.The mic is pretty much what made me buy this. Quality of sound on call is very good and I majorly only use them for attending calls and watching videos on YouTube; Netflix and Amazon Prime. They work pretty well for the purpose.Cons:I use a Nokia 8 and these headphones give a constant buzzing noise in calls while the other person on call talks. The little connecter is even worse. Mutes my voice completely on the other side. Consider this if you use a Nokia phone.

Sennheiser‚Äôs engineering is yet again proven to be the best. CX 6.00BT may not be a cheap pair of wireless earbuds; but trust the Sennheiser‚Äôs reputation and you‚Äôll be surprised by buying these earphones how much well worth Sennheiser‚Äôs products are.

Either it will get cut off or tangled easily; you have to be bit careful(2.5/5) for build qualityOverall  Value for money. You will get best earphone in mid range earphone.

12351,"Good headphone for normal use; treble  a little high but can be adjusted using equaliser. In the ear experience is awesome also over the experience is also very good. It has a little lesser range of bluetooth though; signal interupts over closed doors. Output is not very loud but generally ok. Most importantly being a sports range headphone it is not waterproof; mine got damaged due to sweating in gym. Asked for replacement from ccare but no reply since 15 days.

7218,"Though on the expensive side of the earphone market;the cx-275s from Sennheiser is one of the most loved and trusted headphones in the segment.Plenty of reasons for this support namely the Amazing Sound Quality from the Earphones;the Good looks of the headphone and German Built.However;the wire is rubberised and may seem fragile to many while the 3.5mm jack connector shouldn't be handled roughly as chances are that the wire may get loose and you may get distorted sound.Overall;a good product with some great audio quality to make you enjoy your moments even more.

Main thing I love the most in Sennheiser is its sound quality.  The sound is Crystal clear. You won't miss a single component of music. The bass vocal treble are balanced. Just catch it if you are a music lover.

7196,"Sennheiser are known for their great studio grade sound quality with a flat EQ; and this pair is no different. I really love the sound quality of these headphones; it is full with equal emphasis on the lows; mids and highs without any artificial bass boosting. You get a flat sound which makes this pair really versatile. It is great for movie watching and voice calls. The mic is great. Everyone I called using this pair said I sounded clear with no distortions. Also these come with 2 years warranty which is very nice to have.Now let's get to the cons; and as usual its the built quality. The wires are thin and made up of flimsy looking rubber. I have seen braided cables in headphones much cheaper than this. I would have loved Sennheiser to at least give some quality materials; because you have to really take care or else I feel the wires will break. Also the mic button feels cheap.Overall; this is a great pair of headphones for anyone looking for rich and clear sound. If you like bass; something from Sony would be better for you.
",4,2
9828,"Overall Nice product; not having volume up/down controls. You need to use your phone to control it.

2155,"Excellent battery life  guys...And bass is excellent..Overall 10 out 10For this...I recommend to every one who want the best Bluetooth in budget

2156,"Good product in this price. Good product & good voice.

10181,"the sound is loud and bass is very good. The song change option through call button is working fine in my HTC but not in motorola; dont knw the reason. Noise cancellation is good on this headset. overall a good buy @1675
",4,2
10618,"Good
",4,2
7192,"Let me get this straight; the sound from these is amazing. The highs and mids are clear and the low bass end is great. Recommended for bass heads. Fit is comfortable and they don't fall off from the ears.Now the shortcoming; these earphones are not durable. The wire is very thin as compared to other earphones. In the unit I received; sound from the right ear piece had reduced to half after only 3 months of use. But as Sennheiser gives 2 years of warranty; they replaced the earphones without asking any questions. Right now using the replacement ones and they've been working great.
",4,2
7221,"So I have been using the current pair of CX 275s for more than 6 months now. I use them regularly on my daily commute (of an hour) to work on my bike as well as in the office for Skype calls (which usually means nearly 4-4.5 hours out of the 9 hours at work)The Sound quality is good. However; if you are looking for extra bass then perhaps these may not be where you should be looking at.They are quite comfortable for regular use and the noise-cancellation is quite good at this price point. The 2 year warranty that is provided; makes these the most bang for buck earphones. If ever; you face issues with the earphones as long as they are within the warranty period; replacement is quite hassle free. (Applies to the CX180 as well which I owned earlier as well)To sum it all up; if you are looking for a good pair of multi-purpose earphones for regular use you cannot go wrong with these.

",4,2
8434,"These are good; but cx-180 are much better for music on the go; if you want to buy earphones for solely music purpose;  go for 180; go for these if you want to be able to take calls on the go as well. Also these are better in terms of build quality than jbl t100 or t150

",4,2
11527,"Overall the earphones are pretty impressive.The only reason I am giving it 4 stars and not 5 is because of the wuality of the wire used.Looks kinda cheap.

8189,"Its been a month of use.. This awesome headphone. Seriously its just really great those quality; sennheiser hats off.. Had a confusion on authenticity at first but it was sorted out at much ease by the customer support .. Only thing I don't like with this one is the normal wire.. It could've been flat; the normal one just tangles. Don't wait if its available for a good price.. JUST GO FOR IT.. Won't dissapoint..
",4,2
8190,"The product is good ..and the sound quality is excellent....I used skull candy previously but compared to that; this is way more powerful...and checked the authenticity of the product in the sennheiser website and it turned out to be authentic...so good gng

",4,2
9222,"great sound quality; only two more additions can make this model as one of best earphones to own in this price range; one - add volume controls and two - headphone jack should be bent one like CX 170 rather than the straight one; this one can break soon if are use to have phone in the front pockets of your jeans.

10958,"Good quality of sound but price of item is high as compared to quality

So I returned it and thinking of buying cx 180.I have to mention that customer service by amazon is amazing. I had some issues in getting the refund. They solved my problem throughly.

8321,"Very very excellent headphone...1.5 years after purchasing this headphone I write this review...very reliabled and value for money...sound quality and noise isolation is awesome...bass is ok...but its need to be improved...but very very super headphone..!
",4,2
9162,"Don't think twice before buying this; the noise cancellation is obsolete which makes the sound even better. 4 stars because they would have been the best earphones to buy if they had a flat tangle free wire; trusted brand and a 2 year warranty make this the best buy in its price range
",4,2
9158,"If you are going for this product at its original prize; that is 1899; you better save up a few more 100s and get an apple earphone. I feel so because even thought the frequency definition is good(being able to hear a whole range of sounds very clearly) ;the element of bass(that punching effect); is missing.

Cx180 fits amazingly in your ears that where cx275 gets a low hand. Overall for me cx180 has a upper hand if you are not going for the mic

Noise cancellation is excellent ( Don't USE while driving/riding the bike).4. Remote button is really good ; its feature.  4.1-  You can pick the call.  4.2-  You can change the song by double press; and pause the song by single press.Cons:1. Built quality is OK (Looks like Plastic type).2. Thin cable.3. Bass is not up to the mark.4. Mic doesn't cancel the external noise (Like Mobile phone's built-in Mic). Its good to use in closed area / Traffic-less place.

7755,"Only trained ear can experience the Clarity of sound. Initially you may not find any significant difference between a standard earphone which u get from Samsung or Nokia brand.  After ""burn in"" for a while then u ll definitely notice highly enhanced  BASS driven sound.  I was skeptical before buying this but now i don't regret at all.  The design is intuitive. wire may look fragile but believe me they are sturdy.  I hope it lasts long.  5 star for the Product but i have given 4 because of the extended time for delivery.  i paid extra 50 rupees for fast delivery but they took one day extra. I am expecting REFUND of extra bucks i paid

7768,"Using it for past one month. It's definitely one of the best earphones you can get at this price range and I can say it can also give competition to the higher end earphones. Sound quality  is as crisp as possible with deep bass. Definitely recommend to everyone.

Even I've used Sony MDR-EX220 but they are also not clear;  base is good but crispness absent. I will suggest creative.I must say dont' go for this expensive earphone; even the the company name-Sennheiser is not giving justice to quality of sound. Even half price other brand earphones are much better than this.One good suggestion; before purchasing any earphone; first use it.Ask some one who is using it to give you for trying.(don't feel hesitant; its your question of satisfaction; better be known before than crying afterward )Try it and when you are satisfied with the sound  then only purchase it.

10793,"Excellent Sound quality; Best at Mids & High frequencies.

Although; i was not happy with the delivery boy; as I ordered the headphones at my office address expecting it to be delivered on Weekdays; but it reached on Sunday and delivery boy didn't agree to delivery it at my house lying in a radius of 500m. Taking about headphones - the sound quality is best. Even  while driving on a busy road; a volume level of 40 is enough to give crystal clear sound with bass. For some; the price seems out of budget but trust me - tje quality is much more than expectations.

7832,"Thank you amazon for quick deoivery. I researched a lot before buying this earphone usually I buy 3-4 headsets every year. I have used  sony and sound magic es10 recently but this is cx275 is better then both. I wish they could have controlled the treble and lows more. Sometimes it feels very loud though I was able to control that by help of equalizer. I am using this with my one plus one and its working good. Since I have started using it recently I can't comment on the durability but wire is very thin. Pouch is ordinary and additional ear adapter sets are as u get with any other product. So overall its a good buy in this budget range.

",4,2
7793,"Its good. Not Awesome. I own CX180 already and I was happy with the sound quality of it.I bought this just because it is having mic support with smartphones.Pros: Good Sound Quality as always from Senheiser; Mic recording is beautiful; extension given and the pouch is given good enough to carry in your bag/purse.Cons:Not a tangle free wire; While placing the earphone in the ear we need to hold it at the tip. there is no kind of covering layer given at the joint of ear bud and wire connecting it so that we can hold it while placing it. (CX180 has a proper layer which gives enough support) ; I would not recommend this while you have your helmets on the bike. A BIG NO NO. for those who are purchasing this for daily bike travel. as this tends to tangle alot and the fear is that without the holder i mentioned above it might cut it from the tip.
",4,2
1589,"Spind qualoty awesome....battery life is massive.product is very much durable.but the in ear fitting is very hard hope the ear buds will get softer with multiple use

",4,2
7802,"I ordered these for my iPhone 4 after a lot of research and reading thru all the reviews. Original apple earphones set you back by 2.2 grand and I being a regular( read=over user) of the earphones; all of them invariably last for a maximum of 1 year. 2 grand every year is not a nice thing. I bought these and must say I love it. Occasionally there are some minor issues with the volume when it increases all of a sudden marginally; nevertheless still love it. There is mic also which makes taking calls easier; however no volume buttons . You have to use the phone to reduce/increase the volume. All in all a great pair of earphones for 1.5 K and worth every penny. Waits to be seen how long it lasts

",4,2
7691,"it's really good. But jbl t150 a gives almost same quality at considerably lower price (this one is slightly better though). So if u are looking for value for money go for jbl t150a (available at 899 when I ordered this ) or else this is fabulous.. Specially the ear buds are super comfortable (much more comfortable than jbl ones). The wire is a little thin but sturdy. The material looks a bit sticky. Better keep it carefully if you don't plan  use  it for a long time. (one of my older Nokia headset suffered from that. Got tangled and rubber melted and ultimately unusable).But in short if you are looking for a good earphone with mic in mid range budget this is a solid option.

9544,"Good purchase for the price. Quality of sound is good; mic is good. A good buy for the price.
",4,2
7559,"The balance has even between the bass; treble and vocals. Not for less discerning listeners. But if you've got the money go for higher variants.
",4,2
7561,"Best in its pricing categories! The sound cancellation is so good; can't hear a single thing from the environment when the music is on. The microphone is so sensitive that it catches unwanted sounds from the environment while on call. But; that's okay. Overall a good purchase!

11890,"Not bad

Don't get me wrong; these deliver amazing bass as well; but it's all controlled and the way it's supposed to be. amazing sound spectrum and clarity. anything for casual listening and beyond; go for it!

Triple tap to move back to the previous track doesn't work. This worked with my Sony stock earphones.4. Sound quality is good.Although these features don't work when u use the extension that comes along with this. I'm not sure why the extension is required.If you are looking for a decent set of earphones this one is the right one for you. If u are an ardent listener and a music fanatic there may be other better options out there for you.

Low & Mids are not so good; to enjoy  the music u have to keep the volume in  high else you wont feel the bass  3. Bass is medium
",4,2
7935,"One of the best earphones with mic below 2k. I wouldn't say the bass is great but it's decent enough. Audio quality depends upon the bitrate; so better download the songs in 320kbps to enjoy the audio quality of the earphones. Build quality is good.Though the wires get tangled quite often; I find it easy to untangle it compared to other wired earphones. You get an earphone pouch to carry around.

I explored Ant; Tagg and other brands but the JBL brand value and its wider service network given confidence. Surely it's simple yet powerful headphone. very elegant design; no non-sense outfit. Perfect for several hours of music. It is having magnetic lock; which is not mentioned in the product page. In the pack; it has different sized three pairs of ear-bud caps; the subtle Orange in the ear-buds presents its beauty very presently. As far as sound concern; it is JBL. I already own speaker and over-head phone from JBL; which are performing for several years consistently. This also proves its quality. Good bass and clarity; even in minimum to maximum volumes. If you have high resolution audio files; it is perfect companion. The mic placement is not friendly and no carrying pouch is given so; I deduct one star for it.

5284,"Purchased these headphones from Amazon and were timely delivered. I've been using these headphones for a week now; here's a review -PROS :1. Sound quality is crisp - high; mid and low (bass) notes are clear and headphones are loud enough. Given these are not in-the-ear headphones; I still need to keep volume at around 50-75%. But I really think loudness could differ from one mobile phone to another.2. Battery is ok I guess; these are my first Bluetooth headphones so won't be able to compare. Once fully charged I can use headphones for 3-4 hrs.CONS:Only the earbuds/tips need some improvement; they slip out easily. Other than that can't think of other points.*Regarding durability can't comment at this point of time.

13958,"In ‚Çπ2000 price range its a fair purchase. The sound quality though is not that up to mark; at least not what I expect from JBL. Its not Pure Bass as it says its just a lot of Treble and I hate it. Overall its OK just turn on the EQ and change it to Bass Booster but it will lower the volume a little and you can hear the outside world clearly. The design is neat and very attractive but the placement of the mic is not a suitable position. The Bluetooth sometimes disconnects when multitasking. I faced this problem while I was playing PUBG and suddenly someone called when I picked up the phone it disconnected that is very annoying every time as you have to go through the Bluetooth settings to reconnect. Rest its all right. Afterall we should not forget we are getting all that in ‚Çπ2000. So that‚Äôs quite okay. Its not a compromise its a good purchase.

I got it for under 1k on one of the sale days and that's why it's even more of a satisfying buy.. my views on this after using my Boat Rockers for almost over a month extensively..1. Sound is quite good..bass is quite good for regular use (I mostly listen to Psychedelic; Techno and Rock; performs genuinely on all the genres)2. Lightweight - I have slept wearing it twice; never realised..!!3. Good battery life- goes on easily for 6-7 hours with one charge..(mix of usage and standby)4. Love the color- I have a red and black colour one..looks super classy..5.noise cancellation is good. Blocks out pretty much all of the ambient sound even in the middle of noisy surroundings..All in all..I am happy I waited a long time to buy a genuine wireless earphone and Boat Rockers made it worth the wait..Cheers team Boat..!!

173,"First of all; for 999 it's the best.So I'm reviewing this as a 13-1500 rs device.After 3 months of usage-Soung quality is very good for the price.Bass is also very good.Range is 'decent'.You'll become used to in 2-3 days of usage it's comfortable (it's light as )Connectivity and usability is also very easy.Mic will work well most of the time; just ensure it's at the right place.But one thing I'd say you after 3 months of usage that build quality us 'above average' that's all; especially you have to be very careful with the wires.

May be the quality is compromised somewhere between the wired & wireless.Except for this one drawback; this product is bang for the bucks you pay. It's lightweight; comfortable; long playtime and the offer price of 999 is excellent.If you're okay with decent bass; this is for you.Apparao retail seller is doing a great job regarding offers & return requests.

",4,2
219,"It has been a month since I got these earphones and these are my first own Bluetooth earphones. However; I have tried many other earphones and headphones from different brands from my friends like boat; Samsung; sony; Skullcandy; jaybird; house of marley. I finally settled for this one because it's giving more than it's worth when compared to others. These are cheap in cost and rich in sound. Casual music listeners will enjoy this earphones thoroughly.I will list some pros and cons that a casual music lover looks for...Pros :1)Deep boosted bass and balanced music at higher volumes...worth for money2)Good fit; Light weight and flexible neck band with sweat and water resistant... perfect for workout3)Around 6 hours of play time at 80% of full volume and around 1.5 hour for full charge4) multi function buttons and different bud sizesCons....1) little noise at the beginning that fades out as soon as the music starts2) disconnection ( lag in music ) due to displacement of device for the first time only. It gets settled after the first time you move it and stays connected with out any further disruption.
",4,2
607,"Sound clarity is really awesome feels like theatre effect however it does only 50% noise cancellation for the calls which is ok for 1500 rupees headset. Overall good for sound; however noise cancellation needs improvement

Good for bass lovers.5.Google assistant works perfectly.Cons: 1.No vibration for call alert;hence can miss a call if phone is away.2. Due to extreme Bass; sometimes vocals and fine instrument sounds get masked.3. At full volumes; bass is very loud which if listened for long time can cause ear and headache.But there is a solution to the problem; you can install '' Black player''; which has tones of equaliser settings.So recommend people to use it and obviously go for boat rockerz 255; as it is value for money product!!! üòÉ

200,"I have been using this product since early feb and it still works like a peach. The sound quality is brilliant. Never experienced a break in the Bluetooth sync. No sound delay while watching videos and the battery life is excellent too.. I just have one complaint; well actually its faced by the people who i talk to over the phone. Whenever I use this product to talk over the phone; they always complain about too much background disturbance. It does not cancel out the background sound of others talking around you. Rather their voices gets amplified and I have to immediately stop using it. I validated this by being on the receiving end and the complains definitely is genuine. I think this is the only issue which restricts it from being the ultimate product.

It has super extra bass so those who don't like extra bass have to think on it before buying. Battery life is also good 5hour 35 minutes. Saw 2 movies in a day along with attending calls. Charging time is approx 2 hours. One of the good features I like that when you connect to android phone it shows headphone's battery icon next to bluetooth icon. That battery icon show how much charge is left.

323,"I have used a couple of budget wireless earphones in my life and this is by far the best one. The sound quality is just too good for the price. Noise cancellation is just average. The sound stage is definitely on the base heavy side but not too basey. There isn't much loss in sound quality when increasing the volume. On the whole this is a really good earphone and a amazing deal. I recommend this to anyone trying to but their first pair of wireless earphones.

34,"Audio quality is pretty good and the way it speaks bye amigos when turning it off is also unique.It's durable and designed right.It has mic opening towards down and engraved and rest of the headphone is completely covered;which makes it water resistant I guess.Only things is that it looks weird when you leav it hanging around the neck unlike some other bluetooth headphones which have hard collar kind thing and then a wire stretching out of it. As it hangs too low from neck and the those hard collar kind ones look like small neck accessory when left hanging.Either way I liked the product and it does the job. Battery back is also really good.

Here's my review after 1 week of using this product -Pros:1) Excellent bass quality. You'll love these earphones if you are a bass lover.2) The earphones are lightweight and the magnetic tip makes it easy to carry around neck. I find them really convenient to use at the gym3) Good noise cancellation & sweat resistant.Cons:Battery life - boAt claims a battery life of 6 hours but these run out much before that. It shuts down even though my phone displays 20% battery leftEar pain - The ear buds are not the most comfortable pair you can find. My ears start hurting after prolonged usageMic - The voice quality is not that great and not preferred for taking calls.Overall it's a good buy for the price range.

It has a very rich bass and nooce cancellation is also pretty good. Accessories like ear buds of different sizes and charging cable are provided. If you workout and sweat alot then make sure to keep tha charging cap closed because if sweat goes through it then it may damage the charging; the charging stopped working after 2 weeks so i had to replace it..and the company service was amazing it took around 10 days and then i got a replaced piece back with extra accessories..*Conclusion*I would really recomend this; this headset provide a very good value for money.PS- Just dont walk while using it..because the noice cancellation will not let u hear anything else and it may cause an accident..

I used it for calls and for1 hour for music in this time period.There's a lot of Bass. This can be levelled with your smart phone's inbuilt equalizer; but it will be a pain if you are using multiple music players or video players.The build quality is good w.r.t. the price. I bought it for Rs. 1399/-.Bluetooth pairing is very fast. No hazzles.It can be used for all activities but not voice recording.

66,"I bought these earphones on 23 March. My experience with these headphones is quite great. I got delivery on time; packing was great and sealed. So talking about functioning- it comes with the sound quality you will love. Bass is good enough to make your toes move. Mic is of good quality; Noise cancellation could have been even better but I think thats great for this price range. Works with dual phone and for for about 7-8m radius. Battery backup is good. Though it has 10 min charge system; full battery charging takes time. Buttons are working well. Build quality is superb. In short you can go for it if you are thinking to buy it.

47,"I got it for INR999 and that's the reason am giving it a 4star rating. For casual listeners ; it has decent sound . I found it very clear not comparable to Hi-res earphones (ofcourse). It has good amount of bass but not deep bass instead more of a muddy bass but what else can you expect at this price. But it is good for casual music but i found it little weird for watching movies. Connectivity is ok . Not great cause if you'll put your phone behind your body like in case u keep ur phone in your back pockets ; the  connection gets lost. Moreover ; since it's a  Bluetooth 4.1 even the range is around 10m or less. Build quality seems good but only time can tell that. I have another boat product called Boat Rockerz 600 ( it was their flagship product then) ; which is a very good product. I have it for more than an year now and it's still running very strong though i don't use it as my daily driver. Only problem is that it's earpads are in really bad shape so i have similar hopes with this product too. And if you are confused between this or other similarly priced earphones like Boult; tagg and all don't bother they all are Chinese earphones re-branded and marketed as Boat or tagg etc. So i believe they should sound very similar. And the MRP written on them is basically a maketing gimmick. There's no way these kinda earphones could cost more than INR1500.And now for "" Audiophiles"" ;well if you are one ; you won't be looking at these anyway. So that's it . Happy shopping.

6266,"Sound quality not as expected  also paining ear after some time use
",4,2
901,"So I like everything about this bluetooth. It's battery life; sound; range of connectivity. But when I talk to people on call they could hear the voice of my surrounding clearly but couldn't hear my voice. So basically even if it says notice cancellation but it doesn't work.

898,"Durability is really good; flexible and doesn't fall off ears that easy; although the rubber material used for the eargrip isn't that great and is the only con (for which I have given a star less). Also for the price it's available; one can't really complain about battery. Which is 6hrs.

First time after 20 days of purchaseing and then after three months. Now they clame this new replacement is a good one. Let's see how many days it will again goes.

50,"Well i used boat products before they are good as they were before.pros - base is good ; water resistant ( here doscription says IPx4 but my earphone box says IPx5; and that is even better ; you should update your product description. ) ; Magnet lock ; design .Con - cable is a bit long. As it has control box both side and a little hard cable at back; the remaining cable shouldn't be this long.Above all its a good product.

Sometimes the connection was breaking while you are travelling by vehicle but it is not a big issue as it happens rarely. The only thing that I did not liked was the length of cable. It was really a bit long that can make some disturbance to you especially when you are not listening to music and casually hangs it from your neck. However the magnetic effect was working very fine.

Immediately opened the package to see how the condition was; however it came in a well packed box and on top of it Amazon's insulated cover with invoice. Opened the headphone and put charging through laptop for a few minutes and started using it.Pros:1. Connecting to my new OnePlust 6T within no time and giving a sound with a bold voice stating ""You are now connected to Boat Rocerz 255""2. Base is really awesome; able to hear vocals properly; well mounted ear tips helps you to use the headphone for longer time3. Call quality is fine and more over noise cancellation is ok4. Music is so good to listen while driving.Cons:1. Multi-functional is not so compatible to my phone (it's my assumption); where I could not able to got to the next song or previous song.2. Noise Cancellation is not that much awesome but yeah can able to listen our voice properly by the other side.3. If we give pause for 5 minutes to the song while listening through this; you should go back again to your phone to replay it againOverall it's a satisfactory deal and worth every rupee we spend on it. As this is my second product from Boat I strongly recommend this.

Works perfectly as an in-ear headphone; as you won't hear much outside noise or even outside sounds once you're plugged in.2. You will hear audio assists when you switch it on; pair it to Bluetooth; switch off etc. That is a good feature.3. Placement of the earpiece is problematic. I found it difficult to place it initially; but I figured it out later. Now; after 3-4 days of use; my ear hurts because I have been placing them in ear. So that's a bad thing.4. I noticed that the headset attracts a lot of dust when used. So on the black headset; you can see dust particles sticking on.

Its comfortable having it around the neck due to good silicon material.  As this is in ear canal type speakers we.

The seller is selling us version 4.1. Please amazon correct it!! Customers would face the loss in case of any mis communication.Talking about build quality; sound clarity and looksI personally liked it.. Bass is really good no noise while hearing. If you are listening into a good melody songs you would dive into the music. Look wise as depicted in pictures it looks different from the black and red..I use for jogging and excersise and the fit is good.. it won't get dropped off.Battery is ok I am getting around 6 hrs in a one full charge.

Watch full indepth review videoAnd please please subscribe my channel on youtubeJust search for 'jbl 205bt bluetooth earphone review ajit Suryawanshi'So lets start review.....Used the product for 1 month and then writing the review1. Whats in the box? - in box you get micro usb to usb cable used for charging; product itself; and manuals2. Build Quality:- The build quality of earphone is really good. The cable is not braided but actually made up of high quality rubber. Product feels sturdy and premium. Hence in terms of build quality the product gets full marks.3. Comfort:- Talking about the comfort it's personal choice for me comfort is really good but some people found to be uncomfortable and doesn't fit well so i would suggest use apple earpods as a test. Earphone doesn't fell off while running or driving. One side of earphone has soft rubber hence grip in ear is good. Hence in terms of comfort i would give full marks4. Features and Functionalities:- In this area the earphone lets you down. The earphone doesn't support google assistant or siri. The earphone has three buttons. Long press middle button will turn on/off the earphones; while single press is used to play/pause music or take/end calls. Remaining two buttons are used to change volume and music track. Single press will change volume and long press will change track. The volume buttons are hard to press initially but gets soft over a time. Earphone has led indicator indicating on/off (white) connectivity (blue). It is blinking in pairing mode and stays still when connection is established. Earphone uses bluetooth V4.0 hence in terms of range it won't be an issue. You can easliy travel from one to another room.Microphone quality:- its good and gets job done.calling with these earphone will have No issues hereBattery life:- The battery life of these earphone is average i would say. It would get around 4 to 5 hours of battery life which is average in my opinion. It will suffice for 1 working day with medium usage. But on heavy usage you have to top it up. Watching videos or movies will drain battery faster.Charging time hovers around 1:30 hours to 2 hours from 0 to 100%. Earphone doesn't have any fast charging technology.Sound Quality:- Here i would say its a Bomb. It's surprisingly really really good. High are very clear mids are very well defined and base is also really good. You will love to hear all types of music. Instruments and vocals are also very clear and well defined. But yes its not for basshead as earphone are not very bassey. Base is very well balanced and doesn't affect mid and high tone. Hence in terms of sound it will surely put smile on your face.Pros:-1. Good build quality and great design2. Comfort is subjective but it's good3. Sound signature is phenomenal4. Good bluetooth rangeCon's :-1. Doesn't support Google assistant or siri2. Battery life is averageSo lastly do i recommend to purchase these earphones? Well definitely yes; an earphone is know for sound and in this it shines.So overall i would give 4/5 stars as it sounds really goodSupport by pressing help button if like the reviewAnd please subscribe to my youtube channel and please provide valuable feed in comment section. Any questions ask in comment section of youtube will be happy to answer in only minutes.

Since i needed a budget earphone i went and booked this. My first impression in regular usage was awesome. Sound quality and bass impressed me a lot. Definitely for regular music lovers this is the best buy and more than worth the money. I am taking away 1 star because i do lot of cardio (running) and because of music control the earphone tries to get pulled because of the weight and its really annoying. Music control is definitely big and heavy. I have tried cardio on threadmill and never tried on road. As of now batter backup is good. I will revisit this review after couple of days usage.

But you will get good bass; notes are clear. I had used apple earphones before and I consider them the best in earphone category and JBL is in par with it. And here it is wireless.2. Battery life - Is good and holding 5 hrs3. Connectivity - Very smooth and no hiccups of any sort. I am using it with iphone. P.s - Near iphone battery life; it shows earphone battery life as well. I like it !!!4. Noise cancellation - I don't know why people are rating noise cancellation for these earphones. It doesn't apply here. If you want noise cancellation earphones/headphones then you have to pay much extra bucks and buy which specifically mentions 'Noise Cancellation headphones'That's it.

Given a thought i had paid only 999rs;i am very much satisfied with overall performanceRegarding service center; the customers leaving in Mumbai has added advantage as i had.My previous boat rockerz 275 one earpieces suddenly stopped so i visited the service center in Goregaon and they replaced my headphones with new in just 5 minutes without any questions asked.So customers in Mumbai don't worry about the warranty.

5815,"Build quality is not satisfactory would've been better; battery is good enough though the sound quality is good need some improvements; for song changing you need deep press +/- button for at least 2-3secs; the worst thing is the mic though you adjust the position of it for several times whether your sitting; standing; walking; traveling and especially driving it is just shit; while your in a call it'll capture all the nonsense from the background clearly rather than your voice which is coming from just 1cm away. I think it has noise installation not cancellation.

5813,"This a genuine buyer verified review. JBL ain‚Äôt paid me anything to write this guys trust me:)So about the review will tel u sweet and simple.Rating from 51) Sound Quality: 4.5 Excellent Sound as pure JBL signature and BASS is good considering not a ‚ÄúIn-Ear‚Äù type setup. If u want good Sound with bass and not a in ear type go for this it wnt disappoint you.2) Useability: 5 out of 5 I bought it because in-ear was causing pain while wearing helmet but these are like Apple earphone finish hence very easy to wear on helmet also.3) Controls: 3 out of five as Track Forward and backward are missing4) Battery‚Äôs life: 3 out of 5. Dnt go with 6 hours gimmick it will last Max 5hours mine gives average 4.5 hours in single charge.5) Looks: 4 out of 5 Looks Great while wearing the only issue is the Blue Pairing light is Always ON which may annoy some people. But I think it looks cool. Specially on the white colour one.6) Noise Isolation: 2 out of 5 As these are Apple like shape u can‚Äôt expect Noise Isolation it‚Äôs good when u are listing alone but in High Public and while driving bike surely u will have to put volume to MAX to isolate noise around u.Overall Happy with the product in this price range if u are looking for earphones without in-ear design and comfort as well Good bass and build quality then u should must go for these without any doubt.

Additionally I have a Philips basic; a Sony and a JBL headphone. I have bought these for my own use; a few friends and relatives. None of these can compare to the loudness bass and overall effect of these bt earphones. I'm obviously not an audiophile but I know the difference between a good sound and noise. The only concern I found was that the wires hang a lil low and the highs could have been sharper(nitpicking). Cant fault it otherwise. I have It paired with RN5 pro.

I think its bcos of short distance range.Earlier I used to take it everywhere hung up on my neck and it everytimes it took time to reconnect. So all in all happy with it now.

Must say boat has a very impressive online system which is efficient n responsive. The service centre took some time but i have received my earphones back hence the 5 star rating. All electronic items can malfunction but its the after sales service that really determines the serious ones and from this it appears that boat are here for the long run.

198,"To those who doesn't get to know the realistic review about this product.I've been using it for 2 days and understood the sound quality. And i F-u-kin love these earphones.Noise Cancellation is very good. You can't hear noises until you try to hear them.Comfortability. You can't listen for a longer period of time. It will start paining after 20 mins. These were not comfortable until i removed the wings. And i had some old eartips which i am using right now. These are more comfortable to me. And now i can listen to 4 hours straight without paining.Battery life is excellent. Used for 2 days and battery percentage dropped from 100 to 40%.Now the Sound Quality.Mids are average. Won't miss any sound.Highs (treble or vocals) is not up to the mark. BUT; If you adjust the equaliser settings then you can make it sounds so amazing.Lows (bass) is SO POWERFUL. Rockerz 255 was only made for the bass lovers i guess. Their only focus was on the bass. These earphones have extra bass.(i am saying this so many times because it literally has so much bass)The people who are saying that it would have been better if it had more bass are stupid as fun.I have used some high and mid end earphones like Sony Mdr xb55 with extra bass; Jbl T110 and Oneplus Bullets.At first when i heard; i thought i made a mistake by purchasing these Earphones but when i equalised it. I made it sounds like some high end earphones. And i am very happy with the purchase now.You will only like this if you didn't have an high end earphones. But if you have never heard an high end earphones and wants some eargasm then i must say that you should go with the product. You'll be happy with the purchase and dont forget to equalise.
",5,2
10718,"At this price its the best headset avialable on the market. I have been using it for 6 months its got finest sound and good noise cancellation at the price at which its avialable .
",5,2

14010,"Just got this product in hand... Love it already.  I got one in black colour.  sound quality is great for a thin bluetooth headset.  For this price these headphones are worth every penny.  Another big advantage is that it's made by JBL - very well name in the industry.

216,"Let me tell you this; I've used Bose; Beats; Sennheiser; Audio technika; JBL; Skullcandy; boAts and many tens of top and mid level brands. But I'm a fan of boAts for their Price - Satisfaction ratio and used many of their products and never was disappointed.Bought these earphones; I liked the build as soon as I saw them; loved the thumping bass when I tested it with multiple songs; loved the audio clarity too.And then an amazing thing happened.I was wearing them and was riding my motorcycle a bit faster and they blew away. An SUV drove over it. I thought I lost the earphones. But when I put the buds in my ear; songs were still playing as loud; as clear as ever.Button areas were damaged so badly but still; working perfect. I did not find any problem till now. I'm loving it.Perfect value of money.*I wish I could have a replacement*

117,"I feel they are the best in the business. They have come out with exceptional quality; awesome product at the exact right price point. Awesome accoustic experience is what Boat provides and i would go so far to say that they are the Bose of their price point. I have been using Boat rockerz 250 in the past and those lasted well over 3 years while delivering exceptional music experience throughout. The battery started to give way after 2 yrs but that is expected of all these products. The 255 have better sound quality in terms of bass; accoustic; treble if compared to the 250.The wire is a bit too long for my liking but that‚Äôs probably cause i had gotten used to the short wire of the 250.I am sure these will again last me well over 2 years. My brother didn‚Äôt listen to me and bought noise shotz and he is regretting his decision now. Poor sound quality; battery quality; connection issues are some of the issues with the noise shotz.Everyone should give them a try once.I had skullcandy before and they were replaced by the company 4 times in the first year while the warranty was active and i had to throw them away after the warranty expired as the 5th piece also malfunctioned. The Boat experience though has been an awesome soundblowing experience.

Sound Quality is outstanding with High Bass; it doesn't get wet even when i sweat a lot by running while wearing it. The noise cancellation could have been a little bit better; when on call the other person keeps telling me that background noises keeps on coming. Battery backup is awesome also; it remained on 100% even after playing videos & songs constantly for 3hrs. To sum it up; i have to say it is the best Bluetooth headset under 1500. You should really go for it.

( for  switch ON;  Switch OFF  &  Connectivity)There is a small light Indicator on the Earphone that works fine.We can charge the Earphone through adaptor or USB.CONSAs it is a Bluetooth Earphone; therefore; it works great within a certain range. Try not to go too far from your Device(Mobile  or PC )While Commuting If the volume is too high; The earphone cancels all the noise around us. This can be dangerous.Overall this product is great  .

151,"One of the best boAt earphones. I have been using boAt for two years and I found their services to be very very impressive. The audio quality is very good. The music feels amazing. Bass is also good compared to other boAt products.However; one problem is that there is latency in audio while you are playing a game. I played PUBG using these earphones and there was a mismatch between audio and the action performed in the game. If you are a gaming freak and plays a lot of game such as PUBG; Asphalt; COD; or any other game where audio is everything then don't buy bluetooth devices. Go for wired one; they will perform far better. Hope you will find this review helpful!

14064,"This is the best bluetooth headphone I've found in this price range and this has come new in the market recently. Specially the magnet ting in the ear pieces are awesome; it's the most helpful thing.In the box it says ""Pure bass""; bass is not that high but audio clarity with effects is really good. While listening to some tracks I feel that treble is little high but that I've solved by using equalizer on my phone. It took me about 1 hr 40 mins to charge and goes on full day well.The wire which is at the rear (neck area) should've been a little longer and front ones a little short because it's sometimes difficult to find the buttons for changing songs or picking up the call.But overall according to my experience JBL is always the best. No matter what product you buy from them their music quality is always the best.

Noise cancellation is great; before reaching top volume your ambience will be mute doesn't matter how much noise is there... Sound quality is great in a quite place you can't listen to top volume (if you're not a hard core Metallica fan; for them no headphone has enough sound). The bass is the main highlight of this earphone; you can enjoy every beat of music. Great pricing from JBL. highly satisfied... 5/5 points...

I haven't tested the battery's capacity though....but it took me around 1 hour to bring down the battery from 100% to about 85% at 70% of volume. So it seems the battery can easily last for 5 hours. Overall; it is an amazing earphone at this price range with excellent audio quality and noise cancellation.
",5,2
186,"Build: Well designed; lightweight and comfortable. The wires are good and not flimsy; wearing comfort is well maintained; better than Mi bluetooth earphones( the main competitor of boAt in the 1499 price category).Comfort: As mentioned above; these earphones are really comfortable; fits in the ear with no chance of slipping out (unless you're trying desperately and internationally). They're lightweight; so no hazard on that department. Perfect for long hours of music playback.Sound: The most important aspect of an earphone is the sound clarity; and boAt surely doesn't disappoint here as well. A bit base heavy but the sound is clear; crisp and loud. Good noise cancellation also helps to isolate the music playback. Although; judging from a pure audiophile's point of view; the Mi bluetooth earphones might have a more balanced sound signature; but boAt; being a bit base heavy; is just awesome for hip-hops or Bollywood genres. A music player with a good equalizer (preferably Poweramp for android) is going to elevate the listening experience even more.Battery: A single charge gives about 6-7 hours of music playback; which is decent enough; and full charge takes roughly about 1-1.5 hours.Verdict: In a nutshell; boAt Rockerz 255 is worth the price tag and then some. With it's better build quality; comfort; bluetooth range; it packs more punch than it's competition. For the extreme purists; the sound signature might be a bit turn off; but for most people; even for people with good ears; this is going be a great experience.

",5,2
13937,"Awesome product. Battery backup is about 5 1/2 - 6 hours when i am using it continuously. Have been using it for more than 3 months. No issues faced. If your usage is within 5 - 6 hours at a time my suggestion go for it. Voice is clear when speaking; lightweight. Bass & sound quality is great but does depend on the app you are using in your phone to listen to music. I have tried with JIO music; Amazon music; jet player etc. Most of the players gave excellent output. I guggest try with different players or equalizer settings to get the perfect audio. The wires are tapered in shape hence can sustain a little bit of stress. 3 different size of earbuds are available with this product and selecting the correct size does not allow the buds to fall off (Tried it when running on a treadmill). All in all awesome product at this price.
",5,2
247,"I m writing this review after 1 month of usage. Product is no doubt a value for money; quality of material is decent; battery life is around 6-8 hours.

104,"This is a good buy. Sits comfortably around the neck; earpiece is good; and feels sturdy.Noise cancellation is surprisingly good at this price range (during phone calls person on the other end hears very less background noise.)Sound quality - good with Android. With iPhone the sound tends to get crackling at high volumes when equaliser is on. No complains on flat sound.Wires are a bit long; but you get used to it after a while.My only issue with this and other BT earphones in this price bracket is with the voice breaking. If I keep my phone in my pocket (jeans) and walk the audio starts to break and I have to reposition the neckband. This has happened quite a number of times. I used to own a Tagg inferno and MiVi thunderbeats; both had this issue and this one too.To summarise; worth buying; if under 1500.

12394,"I have been using this headphones for a week now and I have never seen or heard a much more beautiful elegant earphones at all.  The best in bass and crisp raspy sound. People say that the neck band is slightly discomforting..  But I'd say No..  I wore them seeing 2 good movies back to back and I did not feel discomforting at all. Makes u feel as if this is not there on your ears and neck at all.Pros1)Perfect fit on the ears2)Very light weight compared to other wireless earphones on market3)Good Bass4)Amazing design and the neck bands do come out and go in very easily5)Very very quick and easy pairing for my One plus phone. BTW it supports dual pairing.6)Call connection is good and it my voice is very clearly audible for the other person while on phone. Mic is good.Cons1)Battery life isn't more than 6 hours as I fully charged the earphone and watched 2 movies back to back which was around 6.5 hours and it beeped for low battery.2) The earphones without the neck bands may be a little and I mean slightly little issue as they tend to slide back off the neck.  If the beck bands are attached; it stays put.3) No one touch Siri or Google now which is the only thing I did not like as I am a great fan of those. While driving if u want to call someone then u have got to remove your phone and dial which is sometimes irritating as I feel.On the whole this  is a beautiful piece of device for 60$ or 3200 INR. Please go for it as it's perfect for good listening with good bass and very comfortable for long hours of gym and musicHope you like my reviews and thanks for reading them.
",5,2
12392,"Of course I am big fan of Skullcandy but these are the best among all the others I own. Sound is subpar the skullcandy. For those who tangle free music experience these are really good.  All those bass lovers these are must to get.I love the neck band it has this blue led which gives really good effect for my workout videos.Even in gym when surrounded by loud music these work flawlessly.Pretty rough usable. Battery is good I was able to use upto 8hours without hearing that annoying beep.All in all for the amount the product is best.

",5,2
12424,"Got them for about 2K; and have been using more than a couple of hours each day. Definitely worth the price.Sound quality: Average; but that means it doesn't do anything terribly. The bass isn't as punchy; and the treble could have been more defined. But; there is no noise; so the mids come through clearly (perfect for my choice of music). The volume is a bit lower than wired earphones; but there is no distortion at peak volumes; not that it should be used at those. You could get wired earphones with similar sound quality at abt 1K; so that makes sense; considering that they need to charge for bluetooth hardware.Battery life: Now; this could be done better. Either the should have given a larger battery; or had better battery management software. It doesn't turn off if it is paired; but not used for an extended period. So; you have to make sure that you switch it off manually. Lasts about 4-5 hrs on less than 50% volume.Durability: uses flat wires; and the built ""seems"" sturdy. Definitely better than my Sennheiser earphones.Other features: call quality is decent enough. Mic is not that great; need to be pulled closer for decent performance unless you want to speak up a bit. Buttons are decent; and work without fail. There is a bright LED on the control capsule; lets people know you can't hear them. Wire is a bit too long; could've been a couple of inches shorter each side; but the balance is good. Fit snugly in your ear; doesn't fall out. The earphones bundle up nicely; and take practically no space in your pocket.Overall; given the price; meets my expectations. Wasn't expecting them to match something worth 6K or more; but doesn't disappoint for the money I spent.
",5,2
12430,"Sound quality is excellent; connect it any phone you will get the same range of output.. connected to my old honor 4c which has worst earphone output in that phone I was getting best sound output on this JBLT110BT... Talking about the battery it depends on your usage; If you use it continuesly without switching off it would last upto 6 hours... If you use it time by time and turn off in between the running time wouldn't more than 5 hrs. ..The one thing I didn't like about is the length of the cable.. it bit longer for no use and it doesn't fit on your neck for no reason... But still we can compromise that.It would give 4.5 star out of 5..
",5,2
1000,"Build quality is just amzing.Before boat earphone i use samsung level u which have no bass at all worst product from samsung therefore i switch to boat earphone which cost me of rs.1499 sound quality is supreb also 1 year warranty.BUY IT YOU WON'T REGRET !!!!

12432,"Writing this review after a year and a half of really rough usage.I have been taking this headphone where ever I go it survived falling down on roads and in the rain ;I have to tell I am really impressed with the build quality and the price was really reasonable.After one year of thrashing and rough usage it finally gave in this week even the charge lasted much longer than usual and charging time was also really less.I would recommend this to anyone due to its superb build quality and long lasting battery.Coming to the sound quality I would give it 5 stars as being a frequent traveler I have no issues and the Bluetooth connectivity is also fast.I wear this earphones inside my helmet and am still able to hear  anything without any problem around traffic.
",5,2
12420,"Awesome earphones. Good built quality. Good sound quality. Trustful brand. Good mix function. It takes less than 2 hours to charge actually. Worthy for this price.All the negatives comments out there are dependent on the way they use this product.Overall I love it.

",5,2
12418,"Got it in a deal for 1899/- and here are my thoughts.1. Connectivity and Range: Very Good. It powers on fast and pair easily & quickly; and I can even walk between rooms without any loss in signal or quality.2. Sound:  Decidedly average. It is definitely boosted; so if you do like punchy bass and are not particular about texture or accuracy; no problems. Sound better than almost anything that comes packaged with a smartphone. Distortion creeps in at 65%+ volume3. Usability:  They fit snugly; and isolate just enough so you can hear your music well but also know what's going on in traffic around you.4. Calls: Under normal circumstances these are fine. Person on the other side had some problem hearing me when I've used these while cycling.5. Battery: Good. I use them for about 2-3 hours a day and charge them every 3 days. They charge in a couple of hours and are good to go. Battery lasts for around 5-6hours on an average.Overall: Easy to recommend if you're only looking for an upgrade to generic earbuds and want to try wireless. Battery life and connectivity are great so no issues there. However; if you're primarily looking for a good listening experience; I'd say pass on this one.

For music and call on an average; I use it for 4-5 hrs a day and till now I have charged the headset only twice.Charge speed is also good as it doesn't take more than an hour to charge.If you are looking for wireless headset; I would suggest to go with this.

12434,"Bought the product despite some reviews I saw on Amazon that the headphones doesn't produce bass.For me; the product is a good one.

5731,"I have bought this earphone out in a store and have been using this since the last couple of weeks. This is one of the best purchase that I have ever done in the audio segment. It has a good bass and proper sound clarity for both the music and calls. It really serves the purpose and it also has a very good battery life that keeps the device consume less energy even if its connected round the clock. With the use of Samsung Level App; one can customize options like Vibration; app alerts; call alerts; battery level; etc. If you are using Samsung mobile which is higher than S7(Unsure if it works for models prior to S7); it also has the additional functions to customize the equalizer level as well. In my opinion; this has been the bluetooth audio device type that I have been looking to buy and I am satisfied with all the functions & audio it offers. I would definitely recommend this for any music lovers.
",5,2
5730,"I have purchased u flex from Croma and purchased another from reliance digital showroom. Whether it a a voice call or music; this is top rated bluetooth headphone. Samsung branding and premium quality looks is an add on. It works best with S8 and note8 above models (Dolby atmos) and it has a dedicated app for sound effects.The most important advice I would like to give u all is don't buy from Amazon or any other online websites. Croma / Reliance digital / Samsung showrooms are the only official sellers of this product.

5562,"I don't understand what there reviews r for either the song u all listen to are of bad bit rate or u just dunno what to expect. I'm coming from using bose jbl n all n trust me as far as Bluetooth codec goes for non Samsung phone it uses sbc which is still good u just won't get the extra teeny beeny stuff like dolby n all if u have in ur lappy or phone but for Samsung phones u can enjoy their own codec which r good sbc people say its bad coz low cost devices use it but u can check the net n research urself its really capable codec just give it the hardware to run it and for other devices that that says they use aptx well they do but their speaker can't even deliver what's the point in having aptx . But still the sound quality is excellent nothing to complain for 3k the kids high n lows r all balanced n superb everything is clear for all who want bass like the Sony xb series not for u these arnt made to enhance bass but its there definitely n plays only when it needs to n i like that not making every little thing bassy is not good for the song too. Battery life is good too I use with high volume ( coz u like it loud) at 100 n boy I got 8 hrs out of it which is normal coz companies usually advertise at 70 % volume. The mic is good too the person on the other end literally though I'm still using my bose soundlink 2 mic. Not sure what's with the other reviews but imma say just go for it it's worth every penny. Noise cancellation is passive noise cancellation u get 3 different size ear tips use the correct size n passive noise cancellation should work

No sound distortion and mic is decent.  But sometimes the mic is being hidden behind the collar of your shirt; so be careful. The battery backup is also good. You can feel the thumping bass when required and might be the sound output is awesome due to its 12.5 mm driver size. I used JBL T210; but this provides better sound.Till now I didn't find any flaws in this earphone. I can say one thing - value for money; you wont regret buying this.
",5,2
5801,"After using 20 days am writing the review .If you are comfortable with these type of headset you can enjoy . Usually i prefere these kind of headset since it's very comfortable for me . You can enjoy the good quality of music with bass and call quality is very good . You can't feel any pain in ear if you using for long time also and it's really fits perfectly and you will thought some times you are not wearing it .Overall worth to buy ; i bought it on offer .

Don't think twice just go for it.The earbuds are the main soul of these earphones. There are people like me out there who don't like the insulated one earbuds. This is the perfect earphones for them.Sound Quality: 9/10Mic: 8/10Battery: 7/10 (Could have been better)Noise cancelation: 5/10 (Reason being the non-earbuds earphones)Build Quality: 7/10Overall rating: 8Worth every penny

5792,"A great product from JBL; as a Bluetooth earphone it's really good; no connection issue; good noise cancellation; good bass and vocals. It's light weight; will not fill any weight in the ear; good connection range. Support both android; iOS in terms of control (buttons). Connect well with laptop but sometimes it's gives fraction of second beep sound but no issues with mobile devices.

5791,"These bluetooth headphones are awesome; JBL keeps the sound experience great as always. Pure bass; clear; and crisp trible. The music  coming out is clearly audible even in at low volumes and high traffic (road) conditions. The only concern for me is the battery does not last that long even after a full charge. I highly recommend this to every music lover out there.

5790,"I was looking forward to buy something which fits like apple airpods. Eversince I came back to android eco system I missed my airpods.  I don't like those in ear type earphones.  I tried mi earphones;  oneplus bullets wireless & Samsung galaxy buds ( horrible call quality!) Nothing I liked.  But these are awesome.  Great to wear;  no strain as they are very light weight.  Sound quality is good; call quality is decent.  If you are like me looking for something other than in ear plug types; you are in luck

",5,2
5788,"Ordered these because of the Apple earpod like eartips; which I prefer to the normal in-ear earphones with rubber tips. They fit really well in my ears. Very comfortable to carry them around the neck. Sound quality is very good...not too high bass; but not too low as well. They are very soothing to the ears. Noise cancellation is not that good...but I'm not that bothered about that.

5765,"I was looking for a budget friendly wireless earphones similar to apple earpods as those ""in-ear"" types don't fit my ears properly.I then came across the JBL Tune 205BT randomly and I did not find any reviews online.I took the plunge and bought it. Below is my review after using it for a couple of days:**Fit/ErgonomicsI really love these earpods style earphones as these fit my ears perfectly.These are light weight and passed my running/jogging tests without any issues.Since I got these I just wear them around my neck and use it a lot without hurting my ears.Rating: 9/10**Built QualityBeing a JBL product I had no doubts that the build quality would be top notch.The cables are solid but the buttons are a bit squishy. I personally prefer clicky tactile buttons.Since these are not connected to anything physically there is no tension on the wires which are around your ears which I imagine would prolong the life of these earphones.Please note that the center button is to turn off/on and put the earphones on pairing mode.The other two buttons are to adjust the volume and you have to hold it for a second or two to skip tracks.Rating: 7/10**SoundTo explain this better I‚Äôll compare this with my previous earphones - Boat Bassheads which is fairly common.Now; the Boat earphones are the ""in-ear"" type and these usually provide better bass since they have a better seal and tunnel the sound directly in your ear but when I used them the bass seemed to be seriously lacking.I had enabled my phone's equalizer and used other software mods (Viper) to improve the sound but still the bass sounded ""hollow"" like a deep snare drum.The JBL Tune 205BT is a thousand times better in the bass department as I found it to be really deep and it has that thump (because of the 12.5mm drivers).I'm really impressed that these earpods sound better than in-ear earphones and are better than Apple‚Äôs earpods too. I also used previously a couple of Philips‚Äô earpods style earphones but they too had the hollow bass effect.I'm currently using the JBL Tune 205BT earphones without any equalizer as I find it to be tuned perfectly out of box. I generally listen to Hip-Hop and these JBL earphones really do it justice especially the 808 kicks.I was a bit sceptic at first about the sound reading the reviews of the wired version of these earphones online but I guess the people who are complaining about the bass not being good are really conditioned to crank up the bass to the maximum which then overpowers the overall sound spectrum.Rating: 9/10**Volume & Noise CancellationSince these are Bluetooth earphones the overall volume will be less than the wired ones.That being said; I found the volume to be enough and then some more.Don't expect noise cancellation on these because of the earpods style tips but that's great for people who jog/run as you have to pay attention to cars; people shouting etc. but turning up the volume you generally don't hear outside sounds. I tend to keep mine around 70-75% volume.The sound doesn't distort at maximum volume.Rating: 7/10**Connectivity; Range & CallsThe JBL Tune 205BT earphones support Bluetooth 4.0 meaning no aptX or aptxHD codec support but that's okay because the improvements are only apparent when listening to high bitrate music (FLAC).(I have subscription to Google Play Music which plays music in 256kbps and I have no issues with the quality).Once these earphones have been paired to your phone; the next time you turn it on it connects in 1-2 seconds.I did not experience any disconnects or any lags. The range was pretty good; I leave the phone on the charger and move around the house without any interruptions.When we talk about calls; I didn't find these earphones that good because the microphone rests on your shoulder and I'm not one of those who shouts when talking on the phone but if you have a loud voice then this might work for you.Rating: 8/10**Battery Life & Charging timeThe charging takes around 1 to 1.5 hours to charge from 0% all the way till 100% and based on my usage (which is a lot) these earphones easily last me a day.Your mileage might vary.Added bonus: You get the battery info on the status bar. I'm using OP3T on Oreo.Rating: 8/10**PriceI thought thousands of times before buying these as I never spent so much for earphones before.But in retrospect I'm glad I did buy these especially considering what you're getting in return.Rating: 10/10***ConclusionIf you're on a budget and want earpods style Bluetooth earphones then please buy this.You won't find anything similar or even close to the sound that you‚Äôre getting. I have many JBL products (2 Bluetooth speakers; 1 home theatre system) so I can vouch for the sound.If you're a Hip-Hop or an EDM head then you can buy this too as these have big drivers which won‚Äôt disappoint you if you crank up the bass using software equalizers.If this is your first pair of Bluetooth earphones then be ready to be pleasantly surprised as these make your lives so much easier and I cannot imagine going back to wired earphones.
",5,2
5764,"There are no cons for this product.I have used it on one plus 6 and iphone xr and I Cann assure you that the sound quality with especially the BASS is super awesome in this.Don't go for negative reviews I was confused seeing the negative reviews but after trying 6 Bluetooth headset s I finally kept this one.There's one button for play and pause plus call receive and cut with the same button.Volume control buttons are present.What else we can demand of in any Bluetooth headset.I'm using it since 1 year ad no problem whatsoever.Battery easily stays for 3 days with each day usage of 4 hours.

You will hardly find an inner earphones that is otherwise.I do no feel comfortable wearing those but didn't want to compromise with sound quality. I invested a lot of time searching for one and it worth it.

8601,"Good sound quality but low bass. Noise cancellation is amazing and overall this product seems to be good quality earphones from Sennheiser
",5,2
7396,"I used it for 2. 5 years before it stopped working. Sound quality is very good. However sometimes you might find some sounds tinny or muddy. But the journey was enjoyable. Go for it.
",5,2
1958,"Sound quality verry good ; i use it during my workout; but only problem is back side made of hard rubber doesn't bends sometimes make it a difficult task to handle
",5,2
7392,"If what you want is quality sound with well differentiated mids and highs and a moderate amount of bass; Not overpowering; but the right amount for a song as such. Then get this. Not for extra bass lovers. The fit is a little bit tricky to insert as well because of the unconventional shape of the headsets. But what matters is the sound quality; The latency is almost non existent on the microphone button; atleast on my phone anyway. No microphonics at all during normal usage and during walking. This is probably the only headset where i did not rely on the music player inbuilt equaliser to modify the sound signature. That speaks about the sound reproduction on the Sennheiser headsets.
",5,2
7390,"The Best headset I have used. Will continue to use same only.Pros :1. Very ergonomic and comfortable to wear.2. Very clear sound clarity on call as well as Music.3. Noice cancellation is handled well.4. Value for money.5. Handy carry case to keep it safe while traveling.Cons :1. You may not like it if prefer more bass or woofer effect.
",5,2
7389,"It is one of the best earphones in terms of sound quality bass is superb and also mids and highs are truly reproduced. I have been using it for 5 years but still no competitor stands against it. Love u Sennheiser...!!!

7387,"After through research & my Friends recommendation I made my mind to purchase CX 275s from Sennheiser within my budgetThe Sennheiser CX 275s is a good headset for someone who wants microphone functionality and Bass response is very well and I can say its better than JBL
",5,2
7383,"I have used Sony; JBl earphones previously and both were very good. This pair of Senheiser earphones are just perfect for me. I felt the its the best all rounder i owned. Go for it without a second thought.
",5,2
7382,"Earphones were delivered in good condition and the sound quality is just awesome. Bought this as a replacement for my Sony xbr50 earphones.Only concern is that the cord is very thin and feels a little feeble.. Not sure how many days it gonna withstand
",5,2
7381,"This is the second time I am buying this because I was surprised how good and well the first pair lasted me...had to buy again because I lost it somewhere.... seriously...the level of comfort and sound quality are too good for its price.Don't go on its looks...it is durable easy to handle...also Bass is very good there is no dedicated noise cancellation setup or something (how vould be at this price) Best earphones under 5000k
",5,2
7378,"So its been 3 days now when product got delivered; and from last 3 days I'm using these headphones regularly... I used these for 3-4 hrs continously but even after 4 hours you can comfortably continue to listen even more; it's very comfortable for long hour of usage also. Sound quality is perfect and is upto the mark; 5 stars for that. Lows mids and high are very clear. Go for it guys; nice pair of earphones from sennheiser.

7369,"Usually plug type earphones don't give much bass which is standard for all brands not matter how big or small. I; however; was pleasantly surprised by the bass. I wasn't looking forward to it much while buying since I know plugs aren't effective bass wise. It's great. I also have another  Sennheiser; same-ish specifications but they aren't plugs; and this one does a 10% better job than that.PS: I'm a Sennheiser lad so my review may be baised (or not). But they are just better than expensive Sony (bass reflex) etc that I've used in the past.

7361,"Amazing sound quality; clear and punchy bass. Good mids. And treble that doesn't bleed your ears! Light to use and comfortable for prolonged use as well. Low impedance; thus low power draw and loud volume. Inline mic is good quality; for calls only tough! Comes with a carrying pouch; do use it! It is not completely tangle free; but is fine.

7356,"Excellent Sound Quality; Excellent balance of bass and trebble. Totally worth it. I have compared it with the sony one which comes around 1800 bucks and sony is no way nearer in terms the quality. I have compared it with the AKG and it gave tough competition. But; sennheiser was little good. Then I compared it with apple eaphones. In this apple earphones had better quality in sound.

7350,"I am a repeat buyer. This is the best in ear headphone with mic at this price point. I have used other products but the voice and sound quality of the mic in this is the best. The basic sound quality of the eatlrphone is also great.

7338,"I've been using Soundmagic ES18 for about past 6 months and I find it very good value for money headphones.The Sennheiser cx275s is also  a  very good value for money headphones ;a little more stylish than the SoundMagic ES18 .Sennheiser cx275s sounds really good; even though the bass is very power it is clear and  not overpowering. You can hear sound of each and every instrument clearly.The quality of these headphones are very good and it supports mic also. When compared to the SoundMagic ES18 you can go on hearing bass overwhelmed songs for hours and it doesn't hurt your ears but SoundMagic ES18 starts hurting after sometime. These headphones also comes with a warranty of 2 years.Finally these headphones are real value for money under rupees 1500.

I owned a pair of sennheiser  cx180s which is still as great as new which I purchased in July 2015 last year. I must say that the durability of sennheiser earphones is marvellous as I tried using the skullcandy earphones before and they wouldn't survive for even  last 3 months. After the first listen to a song; I could make out how the bass is boosted in the 275s and the notes as super clear. So happy! Totally worth the money. And I'm glad I upgraded to this. I'm a total sennheiser fan!

7409,"The hedphones are very niceI had dropped the headphones in a buclet of water for abput 3 hours before realizing that i had dropped it I then tied the headphones to my bike for another 4 hours to dry it off and it still worked and was really happy that it did . Has great sound quality as well . Was happy to shop at amazon and will continue to do so
",5,2
7408,"It's a steal deal as you get much more than what you pay for. The sound quality is great. The set's design is also excellent! I would recommend this product to those who are looking for a daily- general use. No complaints; except for the earphone's wires being thin. I reckon if that would be a problem in the future.
",5,2
7406,"I have been using these earphones for almost 2years now; sound quality is unmatched for the price; very clear; very comfortable to wear long hours & do not hurt the ears; noise cancellation would depend on the volume that you would listen to music; best part is even at high volumes the music is still very clear; would recommend these to anyone who want to buy wired earphones.

7258,"Its been 3 years. I was Using Cx-180 for almost 2 years and then switched to mic version. Again used this one for 3 good years. Bass is great. Sound quality is also great. Overall One of the best purchases till date. It come with a 2 year warranty. The people at Sennheiser India Gurgaon office are great. They replaced it because of some fault with a question. Buy it without a doubt.
",5,2
7256,"Has been using Sennheiser earphones for quite sometime and still now never been disappointed. Best in class sound clarity and even better after sales services.If you are thinking of buying earphones then it's the best option.period.
",5,2
7255,"First things first; this is not a noise cancellation earphone. It's runner plugs keep outside sound from reaching the ear drums. These reproduce sound as close as possible to the source without modifying it. Although the wires look thin they are strong enough to bear daily tugs and snags; and won't break easily. No nonsense reliable earphones that are a reliable workhorse of ear phones.
",5,2
7253,"A review by a sound enthusiast.Awesome Sound quality of mids and treble; clear and pleasent treble ; smooth and soft mids but one needs to equalize the freqencies a bit for that perfect balance of mids and trebl.andNeodynamium magnet - So Active BASS outputBass is preset low by default on this but..This earphone has capability to produce Bass more then your ears can handle  but to produce that much of bass a custom audio driver is required.to play low and ""feel the pressure"" of this frequency one needs an audio driver which amplifies this frequency range.Mobile phones doesn't have this amplification....and cannot be done much with an equalizer from playstore.So dont judge this on its default low bass setting.One con is wire is too thin.. and can easily break. Other then that an awesome earphone in every aspect except thin wire.
",5,2
7252,"Believe me guys; these are way better than Skullcandy method earbuds. I bought these because my methods worn off. I was a little skeptical about these; but after listening to just one song; I could tell the difference between my Skullcandy methods and these. The bass is good; treble is good; it just ticks all the boxes for me.Just that I could be a little cheaper. 2345/- is a bit too much for this model (because it is not the latest one). Overall; if you can buy these; surely go them.
",5,2
7250,"I received my earphones today and although this review might be a little preemptive; I felt it was necessary to put in a word to address some concerns that potential buyers might have. One of the first concerns I had was if the product was fake; because a few other reviewers pointed to the same. As soon as I received the package; I went to the Sennheiser website to make sure that my product was genuine. It was; indeed. My primary concern allayed; I opened the package and I was very happy with everything. You get a 3.5mm adapter; extra ear buds; a pouch; and a manual. The earphones themselves are just fantastic; I tested them quite rigorously today and they held up very well. The bass is not extraordinary; but it's very good quite frankly speaking and unless you're an obsessive audiophile; you shouldn't be disappointed with the sound. The build quality is good; they don't feel cheap. I played a range of music; from your Bollywood numbers to trance to hip-hop to death metal to Djent even and found that the sound was quite good and enjoyable. At decent volumes; these earphones shut the world out and immerse you in the music completely. At the price; these earphones are a steal. I'll continue to use these and revise my review if they ever fall short of expectations.
",5,2
7249,"Many audio enthusiasts have been scouting for good BT earphones; but JBL and Sony have dissapointed at the lower end. Most of the big names have been too busy amping up the battery or range. So I'll keep this about sound quality only; as the range and battery life is as good as the others. Many reviews have been too critical about the ''lack of Bass' but let me assure you that these beauties produce 90% of the sound signature of the Sennheiser 275; which is a huge compliment for a BT Earphone in this class. Since the bass is not overpowering; the mids and highs are crisp and clear  ; resulting in true sound. Yes; the drums and bass guitar is nowhere as booming as on Sony XB55AP; but it is just good enough for Knopfler or Gilmour's guitar to sound true. While I love the Bose Truly Wireless buds sound (sans the audio lag!); I found this close to Bose Soundsport BT performance at half the cost.Bottomline: If you're a Sennheiser loyalist; you won't be dissapointed at this price point. They are light; don't feel much; fit right and have awesome build quality.  These are the best BT earphones I've heard under 10k.
",5,2
7246,"These are incredible Headphones. I had bought a one three years back. There is hardly any damage to the headphones. I use them for taking calls; listening to music; working out; etc and they seem to hold ground everywhere.The buds fit snugly into the ear and the headphone doesn't slip even when working out.The music quality is excellent.The bass is punchy and not super thumping. The mids and highs are balanced. I used songs like Jumbalika; Thriller; etc to test them and you can feel the different instruments distinctly.Recently I had wanted to buy new ones and found that these stand in comparison to 1More Dual Driver and Boat Nirvana Tres Headphones in most features.I'm quite satisfied with this buy.
",5,2
7242,"First of all;  I love the design of the earbuds; very unique. I was using Sennheiser CX180 before this and they worked perfectly for two years no issue at all. Jst that they didnt have a mic so I got these. They are very comfortable and sound quality is great; balanced. Only the cable is too thin; looks fragile it was like that on CX180 too and nothing happened to that so i dont think it will be a problem.I ordered one and after using for a day i realized the mic wasnt working properly and the button also didnt respond sometimes; but i got it replaced and now no issue with it. :)
",5,2
7241,"The overall sound experience is very gud. This is completely balanced for Bass and terrible. You'll experience all the details. This is been six months i am using it. The best part is few days back it was having some issue so i went to sennheiser Service center and they replaced it immediately. I am very happy for their service. I do recommend to all if anybody love music they can go ahead with product; may be you'll say the price of this product  is a bit higher than other brands but i would say quality and service of this brand is best. A big thanks to Sennheiser.
",5,2
7240,"i bought it on 7th march 2015 and i am very much impress by the quality of sound and bass.after use of more than 3 year sound quality remained same as 1st day of use only thing observed that wire covering got few cracks bcz of wear and tear. (after rough use)thats y i was looking for new headset to buy; done some days in r & d about headset.but again found these headset are still the king of headset in this price range.....so bought them again now in 2018...hats off to Sennheiser...üôåüôåüôåif you have budget of 1.5k then go for these and if its under 1k then go for cx180(under 800 with same quality) without a doubt but u have to compromise with mic.dont thing just go for it...
",5,2
7239,"Just go for it...
",5,2
7234,"I was really confused before purchasing...as there are many reviews ..for cx275s...bt this one had better base and sound quality...also...there is volume ctrl remote...so I went for this one.And...now I feel...my gut feeling really paid well...this one is just absolutely fantastic. Balanced sound...decent treble...and bass. Base is on the heavier side. Overall audio quality is just amazing.I purchased this 5 days after getting cx180...which I didnt like ..as the treble was too piercing. Go for this one if you want some bass backed music...with balanced treble.
",5,2
7231,"If it falls in your budget; get it. That's all there is to it.I was restricting my budget to 900 because I have never felt the need for an expensive earphone despite my dialy use;so I kept pushing my purchase of the 275 for 3 years. Finally I decided to get it and it's great. I loved the cx 180 and this is even better. Very crisp;clear and decent noise masking. It's light;it's comfortable. It's got a mic that makes superb calls. I don't think you can beat this ;despite the premium over the JBL c100SI
",5,2
7229,"Have been using this earphone for the past 10 days. For me; this ticks all the boxes; perfect sound quality; light weight; good fit and in ear comfort. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a daily use earphone.Only drawback is that no pouch came along this. Last year I had purchases the previous version of the sennheiser earphone and it came with a good pouch; but this one even though double the cost; did not have a carry pouch.. otherwise the product is great.
",5,2
1996,"I didn't expect it to be this good. Great fitting and very comfortable for workouts and general use.
",5,2
7227,"Don't think these are suitable to working out but are pretty good for general lifestyle usage. The wire is long but is meant to only stretch upto an extent; do NOT test its durability. Sound and mic quality is pretty good; I've been using it for 2 years almost and quality is still brilliant.The silicon ending of the earphone might break but it's not noticeable; the important problem is that the earbuds fall off when you use it a lot as it becomes looser; you get a replacement back (although different sizes only) so that's good.I'd say if you're looking for cheap; good earphones with a mic; this is the one.
",5,2
1997,"Value for money product. Got this for 1500 bucks. Comfortable fit . Mic positioning is well done. Bass is nicely maintained. Overall 4.7/5.
",5,2
7223,"IMPORTANT: This earphone is a quality product. Anywhere below ‚Çπ1400 it is a great buy. The value does drop below ‚Çπ1400 on sale and special occasions.DESCRIPTION:Included with the earphone is a beautiful leather pouch and differently sized earbuds.The bass is good and the audio clear.You may think it is fragile but it will surprise you.The wire is mostly tangle free.Noise cancellation is good too.
",5,2
7220,"Thump is here....what can I say just buy it and feel the thump sennheiser is like Bose substitute...u won't feel to keep it back just always like to put on and have fun....writting it after 2 years of use and not a single defect wires look sleek but are damn high durable as it used to get entabgled to my bikes handle and boss it still rules over every other earphone in this price range like a thallaiva....GERMAN ENGEERING AT ITS BEST IS WHAT SENNHEISSEER RESEMBLES.

7209,"I don‚Äôt think there is any match for these Sennheiser earphones !!! Absolutely amazing !!!I had an earlier version of these from last 5 years and just because they worn out I had to keep them aside.. I‚Äôve had iPhone‚Äôs earpads; audio technica; Sony; Phillips; mi n few others; nothing satisfies as these do. The moment you have them in your ears; it reduces 40% of external noise(remember these are wired earphones).The sound(music; voice; movie) it just heard in your head. Not the ears..;!!

2000,"Very Good Product... Battery life is good.. At this range.. 1099 loved it.. Thank you Amazon...
",5,2
7203,"I have been using these headphones for over a year now and there is zero complain on it. the bass of the sound is perfect even the 4D sounds are really cool you can hear them really well. The product comes with three ear buds in different sizes so you can select the one which fits your ear properly. the noise cancellation it is awesome once plugged into your ears it cancels out the sound from out completely and it detangles easily; have a long wire; the microphones are good to communicate hence one could not ask better from earphones.
",5,2
7202,"This is one of the best product at this price point. The sound quality is just amazing. Loved it. Treble is on point. Bass is powerful. Mids are balanced. Overall a joy to hear music in these earphones.Build quality is also very good. Using for around 6 months. No problem whatsoever.I would strongly recommend senheiser over other manufacturers.
",5,2
7201,"The build quality of the headphones are pretty nice. The wires look very thin and fragile though. Three types of earbuds were provided. The pouch given with the headphones are very useful for carrying the headphones around. Value for money.The jack could have been angled instead of being straight to avoid getting frayed. It hasn't frayed till now though. Very few headphones come with 2 years warranty in this range so that's a plus point.The listening experience is pretty decent. The bass is well balanced. Mic and mic button function very well. The mic works well when its held close to the mouth.
",5,2
7264,"The model and the sound quality is is on par excellence. The moment i saw these headphones and plugged them in; there wasn‚Äôt any resistance in inserting them. The angled design gives a great comfort that my ears aren‚Äôt irritated anymore and I have spent hours and hours listening to songs before my ears start crying from pain caused by the structure of the buds. This for one has two variants and I wasn‚Äôt aware that one supports the android and the other iOS.The reason behind cost difference between both of them is an unknown fact on my side and hence I chose the wrong OS headset since I use Apple. That may be the downside on my part and the length of the wire is an issue which in turn gets intertwined with each other and I seriously fear that because of this I might not utilise the product‚Äôs life.Altogether put it‚Äôs a great product and if you‚Äôre looking for Android CX2.00G is your model and CX2.00i is your iOS variant. Be cautious and order accordingly; unlike me.

7266,"Writing this review after I used it for more than 3 years. So consider reading the complete review.First the cons:1. Wire is a bit thin. But very smooth to handle.2. If not kept in a proper case; it'll take you few seconds to unwind.3. None other that I know of.Pro:1. Highly durable if you care enough for the things you use.2. The 2 years warranty is something. If you find the music is not as good as when it was new due to some issue in earbuds; return (courier or in person) it to the Sennheiser guys. Provided it is physically undamaged; they will hand you over a new one.3. Noise cancellation is optimum. Pedestrians must avoid using it if in heavy road traffic.4. Awesome music quality. You can actually distinguish between different frequencies and different instruments that has be used. Mid and high frequencies sounds crisp. Bass could have been better. Ofcourse you mustn't compare the quality with the ones you get with 3k-4k bucks.5. Use it for long hours; I mean really long time; still you won't find  anything uncomfortable with you ears. Can be used comfortably while you're sleeping in you bed.6. Though I don't have prior experience using any big company earphone products; I had bought it after researching all the products/reviews available online. Believe me I'll again go for this if I had to buy a new one. The best in this price segment.
",5,2
7267,"I like the bass; surroundings; and detailing of sound. Lot of other brands I have used but when I hear the same song with this headset its giving a different experience; awesome sound quality. About build quality it could have better if we have a flat model wires .. all other is good.. and even it's water proof.. accidentally I washed it in washing machine.. but after dry it's got worked perfectly..
",5,2
7271,"It has been more than 3 years since I bought this headphone. Iam completely satisfied with it. But one side of the headphone has stopped working now and Iam thinking of buying a new one. I have been contemplating for a while but could not think of any other product than this one. If Iam going to buy a new one; it will be the same model. For any headphone; 3 years is a good span and Iam sure that if we protect the portion near the plug from being worn out; it will definitely last much longer. Usually in any headphone ; one side of it stops working because the wire near the plug portions gets worn out with time.
",5,2
7325,"Sennheiser CX 275 are the best wired headphones available. The concentration is more on the quality of midrange output rather than ear deafening bass. One can put on these and listen for hours without any fatigue. Bass heavy headphones cause ear fatigue. The quality of sound gives you the opportunity to listen to those notes in your fav songs which you may have never been able to listen on a regular cheap bass heavy headphones.
",5,2
7323,"I could not find any headphones at this price range or below which provides awesome sound quality. But the wires are so delicate and if not handled carefully; there are greater chances of the wire being damaged. Been using it the past 1 year and after 8 months; the left earpiece stopped working. But was able to claim warranty without any hassle. Just make sure to buy it from reputated sellers to avoid getting non authentic one's.
",5,2
7321,"A great product from Sennheiser..Review after usage of 1.5 year.Pro: Good sound quality. Smooth base. Good material for rough use.Cons: mic quality is not that much on voice calling.But when using recoder it's good.Small sound from call button.After 1.4 year use the left ear piece stopped working.I send the fault product to the Sennheiser service center.They replace the fault product with brand new one.Great service from Sennheiser team..
",5,2
7319,"keep in mind to turn the volume dial down....these thing is scary loudand more scary when you add a portable amplifier with it............and for the ones who need a flat tone... don't mind taking it.....just tweak the equaliser to vocal or more mids and high to nullify the bassy side of it. loved the scary volume
",5,2
7318,"First of all; I love Sennheiser. There's no one better in the game when it comes to audio equipments. Earphones are very durable. These have been in washing machine like 5-6 times now (mistakenly). But I just take them out and leave them for drying for 1-2 days and they are back to normal. Cord has been pulled numerous time. Twice; I thought no way these could survive through this much pulling force. But; I underestimated it. I got these as an upgrade from CX 180 after using them for 3 years. I recommend these.
",5,2
7317,"Sound quality is perfect in both low and high volumes also well equipped with bass. but paying such a price i also demand better built quality. it seems very fragile and even the cord is not tangle free on which i compromised. it is not a complete package i would say so if you are going to get this one you have to compromise on some of the aspects.
",5,2
1971,"Good battery life 6-8 hrsGood sound qualityValue for moneyGood build
",5,2
1972,"Super cool product just buy it.I got it for 999/- only.So good to use and fit tight.
",5,2
7309,"First I would like to say that; there is sound quality& bass v/s any headphones with loud sound. I had used sennheiser few years back; after that I started experimenting with  other brands also like; Sony; JBL; Boat; Philips and even some local brand also but I never quite got that satisfaction which I used to get from Sennheiser.Great sound clarityNice bass;PERFECT FIT; And I mean it. Sennheiser fits just perfectly in my ears and doesn't fall out; neither does my ears pain if I use it for long time.Product quality is decent.Microphone is pretty normal just like any other headphones.
",5,2
7308,"the ear buds fit well; complete noise cancelation; perfect high; lows and mids. (buzz with ac/dc; led zeppelin; edm; trance; and oh dubstep; rock; metal; bass etc.. it delivers the punch everytime)  no burn in time required  (tweak your equalizer for custom sound of how you like it)  bass point on. mic picks up sound so well and the clarity of the sound other person hears is beyond any inbox mic headphones I've used.  cord is a bit thin kinda like audio technica thin; but it'll last long it seems.  the pouch /carry bag is superb. verify authenticity online and get the best part of 2yrs warranty.highly recommended for people with headphones dying every six months or so.  a good investment (2k is worth it. as 2yrs warranty)
",5,2
1974,"A good wireless earphones with a decent sound quality and battery life and not very much happy with the Bluetooth range I mean it's okay around 10m but I expected more
",5,2
1975,"Purchased at 999 its the most electrifying deal..aound quality and battery backup is more than expected
",5,2
7301,"This here is the best of Sennheiser products. It's comfortable. it's got a microphone jack with call answer/pause/play button. It's sleek and easy to carry around. If you use it for at least 2-3 hours per day; every day; these will last 1-2 years depending of the nature of your use. Sometimes; rough handling can cause issues. I had my first pair for 2 years and now; I'm using my second pair..
",5,2
7449,"In the name of noise cancellation it it just a freek. It just fits good in ears doesn't cansel noise. Wire should have been made of better quality to avoid tangelling. In the price range that it is being sold.
",5,2
7300,"Very good product.. very balanced sound; not very bass heavy... But a very balanced sound output... Battery life is also decent...
",5,2
1979,"You I'll free from wires
",5,2
7295,"I normally don't write any reviews; but this masterpiece moved me to share my experience with this beast. First of all; the product is really premium in terms of sound quality; call clarity; material used; provided accessories. You can't find such a bass effect on a headphone as it looks simple but blows out the music experience. Only con is the product wears off in two years and this is my third purchase and I buy this only for the experience which no headphones had left me with. I would definitely recommend it for any music lovers and gamers.
",5,2
1984,"The range; noise cancellation; bass; sound quality and battery life are good. The welcome and good bye messages are creative. A little expensive but you won't regret buying it.
",5,2
7292,"I purchased this last week. Good delivery by Amazon; got it on second day.I've been trying different earphones of philips; sony; skullcandy and even steel series siberia v1(though it's built for gaming not for music) for long time to get the best earphone in my budget and now I tried this. I haven't experienced anything like this before. Excellent bass with crystal clear sound even at 10% volume and complete isolation from noise. If your phone doesn't support some of these earphones; no worries. A connector comes with the earphone for your phone.If you wanna have a new experience; try this...
",5,2
1986,"first sound quality is very good for this price.battery life is decent ; it comes more than 8 hrs(i use randomly for music and calls)you can blindly go for it
",5,2
7288,"Wanted to buy this headphones for very long and finally got good deal on Amazon.Built quality could have been better. Wire is thin and feels very delicate. Also wire tangles easily. Although Sennheiser trust is there and I'm hoping headphones will last for long. As of now it's hard to tell if this headphones can handle the rough treatment.Sound is just great. Not a audiophile and don't know about the notes and all but when you plug in these headphones and start the music you can easily notice the clarity in music. I previously used Sennheiser CX213 but I find these headphones to be better. In line mic is good and works well during call.Overall these are great headphones in given price range. Definitely worth the money.
",5,2
1987,"Quite good but a bit expensive
",5,2
7280,"I bought this primarily for audio calls. The mic and the voice clarity is excellent.In addition to this the music clarity is great.The only thing I felt to be improved is the thickness of the cable. The cable is thin when compared to other similar products.But the advantage is that this comes with 2 year warranty.Recommended to anyone who is looking for a good earphone with great sound and mic clarity.
",5,2
7279,"Very great quality of built and great sound quality I think as per price product is really good and steady I love to use Sennheiser product this is my second one.
",5,2
7277,"Purchased this earphone to attend voice calls and telephone meetings and liked the voice clarity a lot. Voice is very clear and crisp. It is also delivers good performance while playing music; bass is soothing and not very high. To compare; I also have Sony WI-C400 in-ear headphones but it gives poor audio; inspite of comfort of neckband i have to forgo it for sake of voice clarity on wired Sennheiser CX 275. I am rating it low in terms of material quality and durability as it's wire appears delicate.
",5,2
1990,"super choice; user comfortable design and outstanding performance. I got this on an offer price also worth for its original price. I am so happy.
",5,2
1991,"Worth for the price.. paring with the second device seems to be bit difficult.. but once u got used to it then it‚Äôs fine ..
",5,2
7272,"I have been using this product for more than 4 years. It gives good sound quality and bass quality. I loved this product.
",5,2
1978,"Good in this price range
",5,2
7452,"Noise reduction ?---------- A BIG YES. @ 1300 bucks in 'Amazon lightning deals' which would otherwise be 2000 bucks at any other website; it was definitely a steal. 100% loud applause for Amazon for making this real.Product:- Thumping basses + sizzling trebles.....nothing much out of proportion or distorted. I am not a technical buff nor have I done any course in musicology but I have had at least a dozen headsets from various makers in the past  and can assure that this thing is a beast. Again; don't always blame the hardware. The same song at 96 kbps and 320 kbps sound different through the same gadget. I cannot afford a Bose but this thing is definitely way better than my native Samsung/Nokia headsets.
",5,2
7453,"I have been using this for almost 2 years now. I have tried so many earphones on the last 10 years.... But none come even close to the quality you get with this one. Exceptional clarity and superb responsive in both low and high frequencies.Each time you put it on; you can feel the difference.
",5,2
7455,"This item has been quite good. I have tried JBL; House of Marley; Sony and Philips earphones; but this one leaves all competition behind. But of late; I am facing problems with the product. One side of the earphone is not working. Since the product is still in the warranty period; I would like to know how to get this repaired/replaced. There is no email ID/contact detail of Cloudtail India Private Limited.
",5,2
7622,"Excellent Pairs for Music with great clarity and adequate bass response. Not for Bass heads. Wire quality is not durable to wear and tear for every day heavy use on long term.Wire tangle easily if not kept organized.
",5,2
7619,"5* for the product;5* for the quality;5* for the best delivery; i got my product in 2 days time;well that's awesome.About headset;it's terrific one i ever bought. I regret buying low class headsets.Great bass;good at noise reduction;detailed audio experience.Finally worth the money i spend and hope it lasts long.
",5,2
7618,"These earphones are literally the BEST! I've tried Skull candy ; JBL etc earphones but this is best among all . You can blindly go for it. This is the first time I bought Sennheiser and it didn't disappoint me. The Clarity is Soo good; even the BASS is Awesome you can set your equalizer too to enjoy more bass if youre a bass lover (like me) . Overall it's a GOOD DEAL.
",5,2
7616,"If you're a Bass freak like me then you'll definitely love this. I'm using it with my oneplus one and definitely having a great time listening to GnR; Metallica; AC-DC; John Mayor; Keith Urban; Fossils; The Missing Link; Fakira etc. (not a Bollywood fan at all). Noise cancellation is very good. Anyways; the build is fragile though. It looks awesome. The leather pouch comes along is a life  saver. It takes calls and does it efficiently. Much better than many expensive butt caps available in the market today. Recommended to everyone. Thank me later.
",5,2
7615,"Let me be very honest; I ordered the product on Saturday night around 8:15 PM or so and received next day by 2:30 PM. The earphones are mind-blowingly amazing; far better than many headsets available at 2k-4k. Sennheiser did an amazing job with each and every bit of the headsets. The ear cushions are very soft therefore you can wear those for many hours; coming to the sound quality the bass output is top notch. I recommend without giving a second thought go and buy it now!!!
",5,2
7613,"Built quality is pretty poor... But sound quality is best in this range... Not for bass lovers... It has v shape sound signature so it will have pure sound... I used it for 2 years... & Again after a long search for a upgrade I cannot find the better earphone so bought these...
",5,2
7611,"Well; I have used a lot many earphones over the years starting from Philips; Sony to Skullcandy etc etc of multiple ranges; be it below 500 or above 1500. But this particular product from Sennheiser has just upped my listening to music experience by miles. Simply one of the best of this range; and as an overall product also beats Sony and Skullcandy at its range. The music; the beats; the overall everything associated with a particular song feels even more vibrant now. I would suggest everyone and anyone looking forward to a decent earphone....go for this one. Absolutely worth it.
",5,2
7606,"Sound is clear and better than any mobile headphones. Only thing I miss in this product is sound control. You have to do this with mobile or tab manually. It only have call pick and drop option. Best feature is sound quality is superb and awesome.
",5,2
1908,"Awesome output; but for battery indications they need to work as it drains quickly after its on 15%

1909,"Awesome Product With Superb Immersive bass boosted effect including Dolby.... üëåüëåüëåüëåNice Fit in ear....

7602,"Satisfied customer. These are good entry level earphones. Not that costly as well. Its excellent on all fronts sound quality; ear-plugs are provided as well (extra that is). Mic is also included. Awesome sound quality. Couldn't have asked for more for this price.

7601,"Hi; I have been using I phone head phone; This headphone is more than Iphone and very compact and good for Webex calling...clear audio in both side.
",5,2
7600,"Excellent. Perfect sound. Perfect balance between basa and treble. Way better than Skullcandy Smoking Bud 2. Used it for one year and still working perfectly. Very Nice. A quality product from Sennheiser. Comes with Mic which is great for picking up calls. So overall a Very Good Earphone.
",5,2
7595,"Value for money. Excellent Headphone ever. I am regular user of Sony. But Sennheiser CX 275 S In -Ear Universal Mobile Headphone With Mic (Black) is excellent. Clear beat of music. Every beat is awesome. Sennheiser better than Sony. Go for it.
",5,2
7594,"I am using this earphone from past 2 years; still it works properly with awesome sound and great bass. I use this earphone mainly for gaming. I can also recognise the sorounding sounds in the game.
",5,2
7593,"Serves the purpose. Wanted something which is an all rounder and the CX275 s fits the bill perfectly. Call clarity is good and the mic does its job well. For prolonged usage; i suggest changing the in ear buds to the smaller one (different sized buds come along with this model) as the ones from factory were slightly bigger than required for me.
",5,2
7592,"Headphones are not bass heavy. A little too low for my liking. They seem good for vocals and watching videos. Not noise canceling but filters most sounds on the go. Details are good compared to similar priced earphones. Build quality is exceptional.
",5,2
7589,"Awesome earphones I ever used....my MI Phone have pre set multiple earphone setting.......And very impressive delivery by Amazon.... 1 more happy customer :)August 2018This review above is from 2016 and a week ago they stopped working; 1 month before the warranty expires. And the best part is they replaced it with a new one No Questions Asked; in around 10 min.They didn't answer my calls though (On Toll free number).
",5,2
7588,"I wanted to give 3 stars to this product because of it's accessories' quality given by sennheiser. Otherwise under 1500 RS. the sound quality is god of the gods.
",5,2
7587,"Sennheiser is always good at sound quality!I love this earphone as it live up to the expectation!!!I would say it's worth to buy this product if you're a music lover!!
",5,2
7585,"I have bought these pair of earphones twice because the old pair of earphones i gave my cousin to use and he lost them.These are really good and reliable the sound the material is really good dont think too much just buy them
",5,2
7583,"I've used quite a few earphones in past few years and if i say these are the best ones i have im not exaggerating not even one bit this one have better build quality; better sound output and superior frequency response than my last ones..  i listen alot of metal and heavy rock  and i m very happy with the sound quality of Cx275.. Best buy:)
",5,2
7582,"Very convinient product with its small carriage bag.the qualitly is superb like sennheiser products are! Works best with andriod phones ; the iphones dont allow few of the fuctions due to different confugiration i suppose. The sound quality is awesome. With its case travelling with earphones is taken care ofüòé
",5,2
7581,"I ordered this product by seeing the brand name.  Quality of headset is very good and I am using it is for calls;  listening to songs etc..
",5,2
7580,"Earlier I had given this a 1/5 but now it has grown on me. Very crisp sound for this price point. Not the best IEM but 'almost' audiophile.
",5,2
7578,"a good product from sennheiser ;but cable length was too long apart from that everything good ; i recommend this product and most importantly service was excellent and if any damage will happened they will provide with new item replacement . i would give 4.5 star rating for this product.
",5,2
7574,"suggested more of my friends to buy this. everything you need in an earphone is their base is not that punchy but it remains true to the music how it was made no added base and treble if you are music head you know what i mean
",5,2
7624,"Best of the best sound quality but slightly dissapointed with the material quality but overall a great deal....  if you wanna hear the every beat of music then blindly go for it... far better than JBL; Sony; Skullcandy; Boat; etc;. ""Sennheiser"" Name is enough!!!!
",5,2
7625,"Awesome sound quality. You can feel the audio crystal clear with amazing effects and I love it. It's much better than Jbl T series. Control & mic works good.
",5,2
7626,"Within this price range the best sound output it produces and of course the build quality is not that much good as it can be broken with a minimal rough usage; which is already happened in my case.
",5,2
7627,"Really speaking for 5 years; I have used Skullcandy; Soundmagic; JBL; Motorola & Philips from the range of 700-2500 but I guarantee this one is the best among all of them under that range. Don't think anything else & just go for it. Super Noise cancellation with extra bass.
",5,2
7673,"I just received these bad boys today let me tell u this by far these r the best pair I ever had I have used jbl Sony skull candy creative sound magic audio technicia but these headphones r where I stop its just going to be these here on.Crystal clear sound n those u love a good bass effect than man there r ur thingI ordered them yesterday n I received them today by far the best in the price range just close ur eyes n go for it üëç
",5,2
7672,"I received the earphones within a day thanks to amazing Amazon delivery. I have used the headphones for 2-3 days and I am very impressed by its sound. Sennheiser never disappoints when it comes to sound; I have another model MX-170 and I have been using it for last 5 years and it still gives that good sound as ever. This has got a more than average bass to it; and the sound clarity and all sounds which are overpowered by bass can be heard. Mic also a big advantage; and its fits into the ear perfectly ; no chance of falling out. There are multiple options depending upon ear size. The only bad thing is that it gets tangled very easily; and becomes a hassle to untangle.
",5,2
7670,"Sound quality amazing. I listened sounds boat ; Sony; scullcandy ; JBL; prices about 4000/- ; it's sound quality  equal to these brands. Clarity is amazing. Even I bought 1more triple driver . Cx275s sounds quality is better than 1more. Reviewing after 6 months.
",5,2
7669,"Purchased from cloud tail.(authorised seller for sennheiser in amazon).Very Very fast delivery.One of the best ear phones with mic. if microphone is not required then should definitely consider other options such as  CX 180 produces the same sound quality with some less Bass and sony mdr-xb30EX with heavy Bass.Pros  Very good sound quality.  Micro phone  Bass is very good (Thumps after 10 - 15 hr usage)  2 years warranty (no brand dare to give it.)  Leather Case.Cons  Build quality is low no tangle free cable.  Price must be little bit less (very high more than twice that of CX 180 which has better build quality)

7646,"Really good earbuds. What i like more about these is the directional separation of different sounds which is really good for immersion. And bass is okay too.. And these get really loud. At the maximum sound there is apparent distortion but trust me you aren't going to get volume that high since is really loud..

7644,"I own this one & sony xb55ap.Sound quality & base are excellent.Plus point over xb55ap is it's comfortable fit.very lightweight & you can use it for longer time without any problem.Build quality can be improved.Go for it; if you are not a rough user

7643,"Wanted a nice earphone with mic. After searching for days ; finally decided to buy this.As; till now its been only 2 weeks and experiecne is fine. Cost with mic is a bit high ; more than double ; as without mic price was 700 approx.Overall sound quality : awesome ( i previously had samsung earphone and sennisser headphone; hence comparing it form my previous earphone)

7641,"One of the best earbuds for this price!! The clarity is amazing; the bass is good. What more can you ask for! The only negative I feel is that the wires could have been a little thicker and sturdier..not that it will snap just like that..but still!! An excellent buy!!

7640,"I have 3 different earphones of Sennheiser; CX180 Street II; CX275 & Now CX2.00G;Sennheiser has excellent build quality and of course no doubt about its sound; it has balanced bass with clear treble.

Calling quality is great as well. A must buy

7635,"The product is having pretty good sound quality; it comes with a connector for adjusting to some phones; in my case I had to use that connector to Nokia 206 for the proper connection. Otherwise it fits in the 3.5mm jack. Good quality; along with mic.

7628,"Love the clarity of the Headset. If equalizers are adjusted it will give a dynamic sound and will not miss the crystal sound of the set.It blocks the out side sounds and use carefully while driving (especially riding a bike).Value for money and timely delivery from Amazon.

7647,"I have used a lot of ear pods beats; Sony ; Jbl etcBut this is the best I personally feel coz if someone a bass lover and clarity this one's the ultimate. Its tiny but when you push em in ur ears it blocks outside world and then it begins. The microphone is also very clear.Con: The microphone dsnt have a noise cancellation

7200,"Sennheiser CX275s is a superb in the ear headset. Sound quality is awesome with clear reach bass. Carry with a synthetic pouch & a 3.5mm connector. Packaging also great. Only cons was wire too thin. Before I used cx180. After 10months used cx180 one-sided earphone was showing defects. I login a complain. I would send that product to sennheiser headquarters. Then they should send a new product to me between 10days. I want say to sennheiser you are No1 brand in the world;  so concentrate on wire quality. Then no any other brand can reach you

7506,"So-So..... I was using xperia stock Mh750 ACIA  in ear that comes with Z2. Mh750 has a deeper bass. And I have sony mdr30 as well; although mdr30 suppress everything due to extra bass and it's not good but it has a mild treble which sooth my ear. Anyway its upto people what they like.Edit 2: after 5hr burn; bass feels good; but treble is a bit harsh still.

7490,"I have a collection of various headphones; but must say that this is ths the best headphone atleast in sub 2k price range.I regularly listen music in my Moto G 1st gen; and I am quite serious about audio quality of the phone and the headsets. I; may not be an audiophile but can assure that this excellent headphone have the most balanced; precise audio output capabilities.Headsets I have used-1) sony mdr ex 30 - too bass heavy; audio not clear; bulky2) Creative ep630 - less bass; short wire; less warm sound3) Nokia wh205 - very good audio output; slightly bassy; not crystal clear sound as sennheiser; wire don't tangles.4) Cowon em1 - at par with Nokia wh205. Slightly midtone heavy5) soundmagic es18s - just bought  cannot beat sennheiser; but 2nd best; good balance; not very loud; good cable; but gets tangled.6) sennheiser cx 275-Pros- good balance between bass and treble; lows are clear and crisp; quite loud; very comfortable; excellent noise isolation; nice bagCons- slightly excess treble; mids not perfect; wires get tangled; cables are thin.There is hardly any headphone without any limitations; still I must say that this item satisfied my needs more than enough. I will purchase another one.

It has proper and clear treble. lows; mid and high are all clear; constant and smooth. Base is beautiful as it should be or as has been recorded in the studio and does not loose even on high. I am enjoying listening at every level of volume. Under Rs. 2000/-; the best bye !

7486,"Good bass though not top notch but at this price point it can't get better than this i suppose. Sound quality at high and lows are good and there is no distortion. The carrying case provided with it is a nice. I got it for 1500 and it's worth the money.

7480,"AWESOMMMMMMEEEEEBought this from Cloudtail; Good quality and fast delivery. Coming to the Headphones; These are Bassy. One of the best pairs I own till date. I have owned Sony; Samsung; HTC; Lenovo; Beats and my previous best earphones the MI Pistons 2.I used to think the Piston had some good Bass and clarity but after hearing the Sennheiser cx275s; Am just in Aw. And the best part is that the performance is out of the box; The headphones will get better with play.You can hear individual bass beats and it sounds nice. Also the Mids are good(Not best but still pretty nice). Highs are also pretty nice.ONLY CON:The Wires seem very Fragile. Too thin.Mic seems ok quality. But You buy these cx for their sound quality so who cares about the mic
",5,2
7477,"Select the cushions right and you are in for a treat. I ordered one and found the bass flat in contrary to the reviews -  I returned it - Since its Amazon fulfilled - it was hassle free - Ordered an another one as I highly trust Sennheiser products and thought the 1st one was a manufacturing defect - Got the second one and found the bass to be meh however this time I opened the entire package and switched to the largest cushion which instantly transformed the entire experience; you instantly switch to a club experience... There Hope you find it helpful

7468,"Awesome sound quality! I love it :-)The box contains my CX275s; two extra earbuds (one large; one small pair); carry pouch.I just listened one song on this; would update more later.EDIT: They worked for 2 years straight on. This is really good. I purchased on 29 Aug 2015 and only around Oct 2017 it started having issues with one earphone not giving sound. It cost me Rs.1791 for 2 years; that is Rs. 2.4875 per day. Any other Rs. 500 earphone would have started giving issues in 6 months which would be costlier. The sound quality is really good. I am not a bass-head; I don't want my eaphones to boom base. I like music; and these are perfect. They don't focus on base. These earphones got pulled on many times; when I thought these would be done. They got twisted. It suffered through all that and didn't stop working. So it's durable.

7513,"I was confused between Sony MDR xb30ex and these earphones. But I was getting Sennheiser at Rs.1300  in sale so I ordered them.Looks : they look niceBuild quality:the wire is very thin but not  fragile.Still you have to be careful.Sound: with EDM songs you are doing in another world . For hip hop the base is just as much needed.They actually sound beautiful with every genre.Lastly let me say under Rs.2000 buying these pair will be your best decision.And for price I got Rs.1300 I think I cannot be more lucky to own them.
",5,2
7515,"The CX275s is a really market worthy earphone. The bass is amazing; you can clearly feel the pounding of the beats. The vocals is crisp and clear and does not interfere with any other sounds. Movies; songs; games; calls; radio all sound amazing.The noise cancellation is pretty amazing. I have had trouble with in-ear pieces on the Apple or Sony headsets; but this one fits extremely well. People now tap me to draw my attention; it's that good. The build looks fragile but is actually very sturdy.I got this product at a lightning deal during #FreedomSale and the product arrived on time; so no complaints with Amazon's delivery. However; the 3.5 mm connector that is provided with the box is a defective one. Not sure if Amazon or Sennheiser will replace that as it's been more than a month now and I never registered a grievance on the same.

For anyone looking for a good earpiece with a mic; this masterpiece is bang on.Bass lovers may not like it as much; but if you're looking for details and practicality; CX 275S is what you would love at this price point.No sound distortion even at peak levels.Love this piece of engineering. <3
",5,2
7560,"It's a very good product. Sennheiser always delivers a superior studio quality sound; nevertheless the headphone is noise-free or not. This product is a complete noise-free one; no noise from even besides you can interfere between your music moments. The quality of the sound is; as I've said; studio-quality. You can feel the sound waves grooving inside your head; if the music you're listening to is intended to be felt so; I mean; that is possible with this product. And the carrying pouch is nice; by the way.The only con; you can't hear what your friend is telling you sitting beside you.

Bass is very impressive. In my OnePlus One device i dont even need to use Audio FX to boost any of the original sounds in a song. Havent tried taking calls yet but m sure it will be good. Noice reduction is pretty amazing even on low volumes.Cons:To get perfect sound effects you need to raise the volume upto 30 %. The build quality seems to be flimsy; but am sure the 2 years warranty will take care of that. Could have also added volume controls with mic and remote button for taking calls.

7540,"The best Headset in low range for pure music listening.  I earlier had a Sony regular headset which was complete in itself.  The Beats and Bass of that one were better than any headset I have encountered.But after listening through this it took me to a whole new level of musical approach. The Beats and music detail are so clear that even at lowest volume you can feel every single beat.The Headset fitting in ears is awesome. You can listen to the songs for hours without hurting your ears.The Noise reduction is perfect as even at low volumes you can experience all the fun.TheBut be cautious as it is not for persons who love Boombox type music.  The Overall bass is good but it isn't made for Bass based music. So if you want Bass go with Sony or Jbl but if you want beats;  obviously this is the One.I am writing this review after 6 months of purchase and have not encountered a single problem with the product.

6835,"I'm personally not a fan of the ear-plug type earbuds so I went for this. Initially; I was skeptical of the audio quality because these won't be able to seal into the ears as good as the plugs. However; to my surprise; their bass is comparable to some good quality in ears from the likes of Mi & Altec Lansing.Overall; I don't regret my purchase; Got these delivered next morning with amazon prime.Talking about the sound quality; sound is slightly bass heavy and suits my taste. The sound stage is colored and the highs are sometimes faded to compensate for the lows but it doesn't mean that they don't sound good. These sound fantastic!Anyone who wants to listen to EDM or Bollywood go for these. Good product from JBL.

7187,"Have been using it for over 10 days now and have been testing these beauties under extreme conditions and therefore thought of sharing my experience with this product. I will try to keep it short and to the point.Note : you get 2 years domestic warranty with the product and to check the authenticity of the product; do scan the QR code given on the box.So here we go :üëâLook And FeelPremium- thats what you will feel when you hold in your hand for the first time. The material is of excellent quality and offers great durability. The earphones are slightly curved which fits in your ears very comfortably. The three button remote is of high grade rubber and feels smooth while touching.üëâConnectivityThe CX6 from Sanheiser comes with bluetooth 4.2 and connecting your phone is a butter smooth operation. I have tested it with a distance  of about 15 meters and never faced any issue.üëâBattery and ChargeThe product claimed of a 6 hours long battery backup but you will get around 5 to 5 and a half hours. But the best part is it supports Quick charge and even a 5 minutes of charge can give you over 1 hour of support.üëâSound OutputThis is where the real test starts when we talk about a headphone and specially when it is at this cost. I have used BT headphones of other companies and can assure you that at this price point; its not the beat sound output but there are no competitors too. The sound is crisp and clear. The treble is just awesome; you can hear every lows and highs of it but the bass is not the best. The bass should have been a little more because thats what I like but again thats depends on person to person. But I can assure you that you will be pleased to hear the music in this headphone and even for long continuous hours.For those giving negative reviews; its adviced that you download the song at the best bitrate and then try this headphone.üëâCALL QUALITYHave been using it since 10 days now and during all these days; I have tried to use it as rough as I could in all kind of noisy and louder situations but the product has never disappointed me. The sound cancellation works simply superb and the other party could hear me clearly even when I was in the noisiest condition. Never faced any issue over call quality till date. But many months to go and hoping that the brand will keep its good name as it usually does. Kudos‚úåÔ∏èüëâVERDICTSANHEISER has been understanding music and sound since 70 years and one thing can be assured that you wont be disappointed with their product. If you are a Sanheiser user; there is nothing to be said about the quality but about this product; you can definitely give it a try and you wont be disappointed and for those who are planning to buy Sanheiser for the first time; reading reviews wont help you; you need to make a BUY and experience it yourself. Since I have been using this product; I can assure you that using BT headphones for longer hours will not be a pain for your ears anymore. I hope that this review has made you make an informed PURCHASE decision because overall you would be spending your hard earned money. Thanks for reading and Happy Shopping !!

7184,"I don't know why this earphone is getting a lot of hate from a lot of people. Quite frankly I've tried tons of earphones at this price point and personally the right amount of bass and excellent lows and mids would describe this earphone. If you want Xtreme bass then I would suggest you to go for Sony or JBL earphones. But this is a balanced earphone with the right amount of bass and good clarity.

7182,"After successful of senneheiser CX 180 Street II series I thought I have to purchase CX 275s with microphone. When I put on Dolby Atoms mode it is really work as a beast. Nice sound quality powerful bass. It's wirea are thin but looks sturdy and strong I think it would be long lasting headset. And also One & Only Senneheiser name is enough for music lovers. Many people have different kind of ear phone but when I say I have this beast Senneheiser CX 275s other guys said Dada tusi great ho. Really appreciate you Senneheiser!!!:) How could YOU make this type sound quality which have other have name & brand name also but no one can beat you... Thanks a lot for making this kind of ear phone. And also Many Many thanks for Amazon to giving me this type deal and headset. This is gift fromy lovely DAD. Thanks PAPA...for UR love.

7181,"Firstly I would like to appreciate Amazon.in for its amazingly fast delivery. The product reached in less than 24hrs and I opted for regular delivery.Now about the Product.I have used or still use products like Audio Technica ATH-M50X ; Beats Studio; Powerbeats 2 ; Jaybird X2 ; Panasonic Extra Bass ; Bose SoundTrue; Mi Piston3; etc .These Sennheiser earphones are firstly extremely comfortable and lightweight. They have a very loud sound output. The bass is 4/5; Treble is 4/5. The sound quality is rich and it doesn't feels like a sub 2k earphone. The earbuds are small and therefore allow a comfort fit while listening lying down or sleeping and they do not poke or irritate while listening for long hours.I purchased it for Rs 1600/- ; it comes with a leather case and a L - Shaped converter which is very thoughtful .Overall i would highly recommend.
",5,2
7180,"I have used wide ranges of earphones over years; some brands being Skullcandy (Smokin Buds 2); JBL (T 210); Sennheiser (HD 180; HD 210; CX 271; CX400 II Precision; CX 185 Street II; and now CX 275 S) Fiio (f1); Koss (Porta Pro) Audio Technica (ATHCOR150RD);First off there is a large difference between CX 185 Street II and CX 275 S don't even compare; CX 185 has too much of treble with very low bass; CX 275 S is very well balanced; CX 275 S reminds me of my CX 271 which I used for 7 years; its wire was of great quality and tangle free; I would have easily paid an extra 1k for that kind of cable;To anyone looking to buy earphones; go for Audio Technica>JBL if your budget is below 1k and Sennheiser CX 275 S if you just need the best audio output; and regarding other earphones I've used JBL has decent output; and regarding Fiio f1 it is just a piece of crap; it was an impulsive decision I made based just on the brand without any research; don't throw your money in garbage buying it; finally make sure you buy it from a well rated seller.

7179,"I usually don't write reviews; but I've bought two of these and haven't been disappointed.The sound quality is good; but for me; the best feature no one seems to talk about is the mic. I take a lot of calls; and though this doesn't have noise cancellation; it works very well for making calls in noisy environments. I rarely get complaints that others are not able to hear me or of traffic noise disrupting calls (a perennial problem in India). I'm able to take conference calls when travelling; which is a huge plus. The build quality is good. There is a problem that the wire connecting the audio input is weak and tends to break if not stored carefully. I've had that problem once; but Sennheiser replaced this without question. I've started storing the pair in the pouch they supply and have not had issues later.The pouch really keeps things secure. A couple of days ago; I forgot to take it out of my shirt before putting it into the washing machine. I later realized this and picked it from the shirt pocket after the washing cycle; dried the pair and found that it worked as usual - a huge relief.I'm not a huge audiophile and don't wax eloquent on basss/treble reproduction and the like; but for me; this is a great pair for my use cases - good music playback; great service and ability to make calls on the street. I find very few reviews focussing on these; so wanted to highlight these for prospective buyers.

Just fevikwik it!- some Bluetooth bugs

Battery- depending on song; I listened music with volume varying from 50% to 90%. Well; battery lasted 7hr+. No issue there.I had mi Bluetooth headset in mind.  But warranty was 6 month for that. 1 year jbl. So went with this.So it's like vivo oppo cameras beautify camera photos;same Chinese manufacturer amplify base to sound good.  It's just unnatural.

8153,"Amazing sound quality. I own Bose and Skullcandy earbuds as well. Though nothing can beat Bose in terms of audio quality; it does come with a very high price tag attached to it! For listening to music while commuting to work I wanted something that would offer really good sound and would not be very expensive. These are probably one of the best among in-ear buds in the same price range.

8200,"Great crystal clear sound ; bass is on the softer side so  not recommended for people whose first priority is hard bass sound . For me ; bass is perfect ; you can keep listening to songs for hours without even any stretch to your ears . Also the ear pods are designed in such a way that it fits your ear perfectly . Also ; it comes in handy when you can receive your calls and start pause or change music tracks with the call button .

",5,2
7866,"Fantastic sound bass is very deep and powerful seems like u are in a surround sound system really good ;but wires are thin i hope they last long that's my only concernAlso if u have a one plus one the max audio makes the earphones even better
",5,2
7863,"As usual Sennehiser gave the best audio. I was using Cx 180 earlier but due to no mic in that; I bought this one and it is obviously more crisp and clear in quality that 180. Though the product is priced more than 180 but it is worth it. Covering more frequency than 180 on both ends gives this product an extra value for the buck and also another great experience with Sennheiser.
",5,2
7860,"Sound is loud and clearWire look a bit weak but its good; it only looks weak.Packing wasnt that good by the seller.Overall the Product is what matters; it wasnt damaged and its an excellent product. Delivery On Time.

The bass is present and its there for how much u need; good thing is its(bass) is not overpowering. The mids and highs are balanced too.Verdict:- These earphones are a good even a great package for the price the sound quality is great design is great and the build quality too is nice. Just go for it.

At first I was skeptical; because I read some of the poor reviews but now that I've tested the product (great delivery time btw); I find it really balanced; in terms of bass; treble; voice clarity; loudness and noise cancellation. Also; I didn't find any discomfort with long duration usage. I just ordered another piece of the same earphones for my mom.All in all; a great purchase. Very satisfied.
",5,2
7844,"I got these earphones and a brilliant price of 1300 bucks! It has stunning clarity for music and for calls. I loved the fact that there is an additional pouch to carry these earphones. Even other expensive brands wouldnt provide a pouch at this price point. I checked multiple websites and still got the best price on Amazon. At a sub 1500 price point; these are definitely a must buy! Excellent bass and treble balance. The add on connector sent with the earphones is a fantastic add on in case you are using older android phones where this connector is a must-have. Just buy this earphone without any second thoughts if it hits a 1300 or 1400 price point. Amazon as always; you rock in your delivery.

7817,"The Sennheiser CX 275s is an earphone pair geared towards the bass lover on a modest budget. At Rs. 1690; it's neither cheap nor over-priced; and offers solid; distortion-free audio performance. The boosted lows will scare away purists; and even bass fiends might find the highs; which are boosted and tweaked in peculiar spots; occasionally tinny or harsh. An inline remote control and microphone add value to the CX 275s; but the remote lacks volume controls; which is a bit of a bummer. Overall; the CX 275s is a powerful pair with a lot to love;Pros - Powerful; distortion-free audio performance with deep; boosted lows. Inline remote control and microphone for mobile devices. Comfortable; secure; lightweight fit.Cons - Inline remote has no volume controls.

Noise cancellation is good but not the 100% noise cancellation. When im in skype call; i do hear every other noise as well apart from the person voice!!! But really good product. Im loving it.. Hearing the Music in this head phone is really a very good experience. And more over 2 years warranty i bet no one would provide for this cost.And if anything ever happens to your ear phone there will be replacement with the entire new one from the company itself(as 2 years Warranty period); which till now i haven't seen from any other company would do.

Recommended for anyone who wants balnced sound nd bass is not that high as in sony in-ear earphones but it is a earphone for all the daily users.

",5,2
7792,"Very good earpiece. Well i have used many but this one has higher volume with respect to others and quality is also good.  The earpiece cover or pouch that comes with it is really helpful; this prevents it from tangling to itself.

",5,2
7772,"Found Far better than Sony MDR-XB510AS & Sony costs almost double in price. One can feel the difference in track sound which one experience through normal ear phones. Frequency range of these earphone makes the all difference. Only thin wire gives the feel that these may be fragile to handle.

8057,"It is good from all perspective except it is not durable as expected.  Since I had the same previous head phone but after ~2 years; sound stopped coming from one side.
",5,2
8056,"Comes with ear buds of 3 sizes. Sound quality is yummy and I would highly recommend it. Buying another one for a gift to a friend. Just go for it if you want good music with mic and a single button which helps in my case for going to the next track/previous track and pausing.Would have given it a 6 if it had volume controls. None the less - it's amazing.

8135,"When I ordered it I was like.. Its sennheiser and it'll be cool and sound would be cool. But when I used it for first time they turned out to be awesome. They fit into ears just perfectly; bass is truly great and the mic is really fantabulousIt truly reduces the outside noises; music is clear and you can hear those beats clearly which you would have missed other wiseThis headset might not be the best; but for the money you pay its as best as it can get
",5,2
8134,"Best headset you can buy with in 2k;  guys really I am saying its amazing; noise isolation job is fantasti.  Bass is not overwhelming; sharp and crisp sound. I used my Z1 headsets iinitially; compared to that; this is far far far outstanding. Sony is not worst but when it comes under competition;  SENNHEISER wins. But u can feel chord is little Thin when compared to other; but performance is thundering.

7939,"3rd time ordering this product.  Mic with headset the only available high quality nose isolated headset is this cx 275s and available for 2k It's far better when composted with 300 stores which has no mix as well to costly.

7937,"Build quality could be better. Sounds is great; treble seems high if u ve been using other earphones around 1000 bucks but covers all frequencies and is crisp. The button can also be used to pay our pause the music. Ear pods are very comfortable and well designed; the best I have used till date. At first I had doubts but after using for few months; build quality only looks delicate but its strong and sound is just awesome; no competition in this price range

7936,"Good earphones with high quality sound and bass. Got this for the accompanying mouthpiece. Had received a defective product earlier; but it was replaced after registering a complaint.

7934,"These have got to be one of the best headphones I've had in a very long time. It knocks the socks off its competition with the greatest of ease.Points to ponder -1) At this price point; you cannot get a better product; build is very sturdy2) The base on these things is incredible; treble and midrange kicks butt3) The noise reduction is very good4) Pair this with a Fiio headphone amp (Any one) and you might just go insane

7962,"I've been using this headset for quite a few days now and I can say I'm in love with it.I have used skullcandy and sony earplugs before but I recommend this over the others(if your budget is around 1500). The sound quality is at its best. Treble is awesome and a good thumping bass. If you want earplugs with great bass then I'd recommend Sony MDR.But the overall quality of the sound is best in cx 275s. If you want to buy great earplugs with mic and your budget is around 1500 then this is the best headset available and should buy it with eyes closed.
